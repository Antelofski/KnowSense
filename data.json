      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure Clarification – Econ 101\nHello [Friend’s name]\nI hope all is well for you despite the unexpected circumstances. I understand that market\nfailure can be a confusing concept, so I’ll do my best to clarify it alongside using a recent news\narticle as an example. The term market failure described by Dudley “occurs when the market on\nits own fails to be efficient with no outside or government intervention” (Dudley). The market\nfails to be efficient because it fails to maximize total surplus due to a misallocation of resources.\nMarket failures that we have learned in class so far are externalities, common resources, public\ngoods, and artificially scarce goods. I will explore externalities using an example where the\nactions of producers or consumers have consequences for third parties not involved in the\nmarket.\nThere are two types of externalities: negative and positive. A negative externality results\nin an external cost due to an individual or firm imposing an uncompensated cost on others\n(Dudley). In a market with a negative externality, the market equilibrium results in too many\nunits of the good compared to the efficient level (Dudley). However, for positive externalities,\nthe same reasons instead cause an external benefit, and market equilibrium results in fewer units\nof the good compared to the efficient level. The efficient level would be the optimal quantity that\nmaximizes total surplus, but since it is at market equilibrium, the market fails to be efficient,\ntherefore a market failure occurs.\nTo clearly illustrate the concept, I will go into an example of a real-world example of a\nmarket failure. In the article, Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns, it discusses\nhow the issue of microplastic pollution is becoming a bigger issue due to the increase in plastic\nwaste, as it is affecting various environments and the human body. The article addresses how\nmicroplastics in recent studies pose potential health risks, such as an increased likelihood of\nheart attacks and strokes associated with microplastics in the cardiovascular system. The market\nfailure in this article would be the production and consumption of plastics. This would be a\nnegative externality, as the environmental and health costs of microplastic pollution impose\nexternal costs on third parties not reflected in the market. Furthermore, it is a negative externality\nas the article addresses “very little of it has been recycled” and “microplastics are everywhere”\n(Jacobs). The market fails to recognize the external costs of microplastics, leading to\noverconsumption and market equilibrium not being at the socially efficient level. To address this\nmarket failure, the government can intervene. They can impose taxes or regulations on plastic\nproduction to “internalize the external costs” of pollution and ultimately reduce plastic use to the\noptimal efficient quantity (Dudley). This may be challenging due to the scale of the issue, but if\nthe transaction costs of making a deal are low the economy can reach the optimal quantity.\nHopefully this gives you a better understanding and if you have any questions or need\nclarification, feel free to let me know.\nBest regards,\n*******\nWord Count [499]\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Consumer and Producer Surplus.” 2024, Economics 101, Department of\nEconomics, University of Michigan.

      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure Explanation\nHey Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well despite the unexpected family emergency. During your\nabsence, we covered market failure in Econ. I am writing to you to explain it through an article\nthat I found: “Moderna Looks to Pare R&D Spending Even as It Pivots From Covid V accines”.\nMarket failure occurs when the free market doesn’t produce the best outcome for society\nor in other words is inefficient. One common reason for market failure is the presence of\nexternalities, which are unintended side effects of economic activities that affect parties not\ndirectly involved in the transaction. Specifically, positive externalities occur when the benefits of\na good or service translate into third parties that are not directly involved in the market.\nIn the context of this article, Moderna, a biotechnology company has decided to expand\nits research and development efforts to other vaccines beyond COVID-19, which presents a clear\nexample of a positive externality. If one gets a vaccine, not only are they more immune to the\ndisease, it helps others who aren’t vaccinated as they are less likely to spread it to those people as\nwell. This spillover into the workforce as a healthier population results in a more productive\nworkforce and lower absenteeism due to illness, which can lead to a more robust economy and\nincrease productivity, positively impacting not only individuals but also businesses and the\neconomy as a whole.\nBut despite these positive externalities associated with Moderna’s vaccine research\nexpansion, the free market does not naturally consider these benefits which leads to the market\nequilibrium resulting in underproducing vaccines for diseases because the private benefits to\nModerna do not capture the full societal benefits generated by this expansion of research and\ndevelopment. For example, if the consumer's marginal benefit or the conventional demand is $10\nless than the social marginal benefit, the external marginal benefit gained from Moderna’s efforts\nwould be $10.\nAs a result, government intervention or other policy measures may be critical to address\nthis market failure and ensure the optimal allocation of resources to Moderna’s research and\ndevelopment in vaccines. The most obvious example of this would be a government subsidy\nwhich could incentivize Moderna and similar companies to invest in research and development\nfor vaccines that provide positive externalities to society.\nIn summary, market failure involves situations where the market does not account for all\nthe costs and benefits associated with economic activities. In the case of vaccine research,\npositive externalities lead to the underproduction of the vaccines, and corrective policies such as\nvaccine subsidies are necessary to rectify this market failure. I hope my explanation and the\nusage of the article helps you grasp the concept of market failure.

      "essay": "To: Friend\nFrom: Y our Peer\nThursday, March 21, 2024\nSubject: Market Failure\nGood afternoon friend, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to explain the\nconcept of market failure that we are currently learning in economics, as well as share a good\nexample I found that could be helpful.\nFirst, It is important that you understand what market failure is. As you already know, a\nmarket is in equilibrium when the quantity of supply and demand are equal. However, if a\nmarket is in equilibrium it does not necessarily mean that it is efficient. This is where the concept\nof market failure comes in. If a market in equilibrium is not efficient, then total surplus is not\nbeing maximized. This would mean that the equilibrium quantity is different from the efficient\nquantity, which is the quantity at which marginal benefit intersects marginal cost as you may\nrecall from marginal analysis. This can happen as a result of several different factors:\nexternalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. An externality is an\nindirect cost (negative) or benefit (positive) that is an unaccounted for effect on society. Common\nresources are rival in consumption and non-excludable, which can result in overuse. Public\ngoods are both nonrival in consumption and non-excludable, which can result in a lack of\nincentive for providing these goods as no one has to pay. Artificially scarce goods are excludable\nand nonrival in consumption, and led to inefficiency because the marginal benefit would be\nmaximized if they were free for everyone, yet must have a price. These market failures can be\nfixed by government intervention in the form of a subsidy or taxes and restrictions based on what\nkind of failure it is. For positive externalities or public goods where the efficient quantity is\nhigher, the government may subsidize these goods so that more are produced. For negative\nexternalities and common resources, the government may impose regulations or Pigouvian taxes.\nA solution for artificially scarce resources could be an alternative revenue stream that would\nallow all consumers to enjoy the benefits.\nOne real example I found that demonstrates market failure is in an article called “Major\nSources of Air Pollution: Farms” that I will cite below so you can access. This article is about the\npollution that farms generate and the negative impacts that pollution has on the environment.\nThis demonstrates market failure in the market for produce specifically due to a negative\nexternality because the pollution generated by farms is an uncompensated cost that they are\nimposing on their environment. This uncompensated cost of pollution is not accounted for in the\nmarket equilibrium, meaning that the efficient quantity for produce will actually be less then the\nequilibrium. The government could help this market reach efficiency by directly focusing on the\npollution by setting environmental standards or taxing the amount of pollution emitted, or by\nfocusing on the production by setting production quotas or taxing the produce.\nI hope this was helpful and urge you to reach out if you have any more questions.\n[word count: 497]\nReferences\n“A Major Source of Air Pollution: Farms - the Earth Institute - Columbia University.”\nColumbia.edu,\nwww.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3281#:~:text=All%20this%20said%2C%20agricul\ntural%20pollution.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI am reaching out to clarify any confusion you may have regarding market failures. A\nmarket failure occurs when absent any intervention, including government, the market fails to\nreach the efficient outcome (Dudley). This means that resources aren’t allocated efficiently.\nMarket failure can be demonstrated by externalities, artificially scarce goods, public goods, and\ncommon resources. Specifically, I will be focusing on externalities to address this concept.\nExternalities are uncompensated benefits or costs that an individual or firm puts on others. For\nexample, let’s take the market for personal medical use devices and the negative externality it\nposes. In the market for personal medical use devices without external impact, we have our\nconsumer and producer surplus being maximized at equilibrium. However, this does not account\nfor the fact that we have the issue of excessive plastic from medical devices causing damage to\nthe environment (Alcorn). This develops into greenhouse gasses, toxins, and harm to the world’s\noceans that in turn affect the surrounding communities (Alcorn). We have third parties that were\nnot involved in the production or consumption of the good having to deal with an additional cost\nof the good. When we consider this in the context of our supply and demand model, we see that\nwe now have a social marginal cost curve that is exceeding the producers' marginal cost curve.\nThis is because the social marginal cost curve takes into account the external cost, which is the\ncost of the environmental damage. The intersection between the social marginal cost curve and\nour social marginal benefit curve (in this case, the demand curve), becomes our efficient\nquantity. So in this representation, we can see that when we follow the market quantity that\ndoesn’t take into account the external cost, we have a deadweight loss that would have been\ntaken into account at the new equilibrium. That essentially shows the inefficient allocation of\nresources. When the cost isn’t being compensated by the producers, there is inefficiency in the\nmarket. With the production of personal use medical devices, producers aren’t accounting for the\nnegative impacts of plastic during production causing environmental impact, so they are\nproducing more than they should be. That is why the efficient quantity is lower than the market\nquantity. Referencing back to our knowledge of government controls, a possible way this can be\naddressed is through a tax at the price of the external cost or a quota at the efficient quantity.\nWhile this is just one example of a market failure, it can be used as a framework to understand\nthe way society can be affected by them.\nSincerely,\nY our Peer\nWorks Cited\nAlcorn, Ted. “Y our Inhalers and EpiPens Aren’t V ery Healthy for the Environment.” The New\nYork Times, The New Y ork Times, 26 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/health/insulin-pens-inhalers-plastics-recycling.html?searchResult\nPosition=17",

      "essay": "Econ 101\nDudley\nDue 3/26/24\nTo: My awesome friend\nFrom: Me\nHello! Hope you are doing well under the current circumstances.\nI understand you feel behind on the concept of “market failure” in our class so I attached\nan article at the bottom of this email among other resources for you to reference as I explain it to\nyou. In essence, a market failure in introductory economics is when individuals act in their self\ninterest but by doing so create ineﬃciencies in the market as a whole (econlib.org).\nUsing this basic understanding, the specific market failure I think is somewhat hard to\ngrasp that is expressed well in the Wall Street Journal article I found for you is the concept of\nexternalities. An externality is when a third party incurs a cost or a benefit that they didn’t\ndirectly pay for or cause themselves, which causes the market to operate ineﬃciently because\nnow this extra “cost” or “benefit” creates either a supply or demand shift that creates a new\nequilibrium point that is undesirable (we are producing too much or too little)\nThis article shows why pollution is a negative externality. This is because the existing\npollution in the Bay Area is causing owners of high value homes to spend even more (with one\ncelebrity paying an extra five million dollars!) to make sure their homes have breathable air. In\nthis example the homeowners did not cause all the pollution they are struggling with themselves,\nbut are now being forced to spend more than they normally would on their homes to counteract\nthis problem. The homeowners are a “neutral third party” that face an extra cost because of\npollution they did not directly create, therefore making the pollution an externality.\nThe simple reason the pollution in this article is a negative externality is because the extra\nmoney spent on the air purification of the homes is a cost to the consumer and not a benefit. If the\nconsumers alternatively spent the money making their front lawns very pretty, this could increase\nthe value of all the homes in the neighborhood (including the ones that didn’t make their lawns\npretty) so that would be a positive externality (as explained by prof. Dudley in class).\nTo summarize the concept I’m teaching you, a market failure is an ineﬃciency in the\nmarket because of rational individual action not necessarily matching up with an ideal market.\nOur market failure in this article was a negative externality from air pollution because it created\nan additional cost for people who were not directly responsible for creating it. This caused more\nspending on home improvement which caused an imbalance in the market which knocked it oﬀ\nof the “eﬃcient” point that would exist if not for the externality.\nI hope this helps and the resource besides the article itself I attached should also help give\nbasic definitions of each of the things I described in more detail.

I was very sorry to hear about your\nfamily emergency at home and hope that everything is going well. I am happy to help you with\ncatching up in our econ course in the meantime until you are back. Simply put, market failure\noccurs when a market on its own, meaning without any government or outside interventions,\nfails to be efficient with its allocation of goods and services. If market equilibrium does not\nachieve efficiency then there is a market failure present. Market failure can occur in society for a\nvariety of reasons such as Externalities, Public Goods, Common Resources,, and Artificially\nScarce Goods\nI know how market failure can be tricky to understand and the best way to learn a topic is\nto see its applications occurring in the real world with real problems. I hope that this example I\nuse related to air pollution rises in the United States, reported by the Guardian, helps in your\nunderstanding. This article speaks on how the amount of Americans in the U.S. that are exposed\nto unhealthy air pollution will rise by 50% by the middle of the century. The emission of these\npollutants from factories and highways into cities and suburbs will especially cause more\nsickness and health problems for those who cannot afford to buy health care and for those who\nlive in communities that can neither afford access to purifiers and to filtration systems. The\nidentified market failure that is present within this article is the unintended consequences that air\npollution has in an economy since there would be higher expenses, less productivity, and an\ninefficient allocation of resources. The big companies or policies that use these massive factories\nor build huge highways through cities, are doing so in order to profit themselves and they don’t\nintend to create consequences for innocent parties, even though they do. This is called a negative\nexternality and it is the type of market failure present in this article. A negative externality is an\nuncompensated or external cost that an individual or a firm imposes onto others and this is\nevident as the dangerous pollutants that spread are not intended, but it still happens. The article\nillustrates how the biggest victims of this problem are African-American communities. They\ncannot afford to live in other places and therefore have to suffer health risks that they can’t fix.\nHomes near these big highways or industrial facilities will encounter increased supply and a big\ndecrease in demand as there is a fear of potential health risks , creating lower prices, shifting\nmarket equilibrium and negatively impacting the economy. Moreover, tourism, which increases\nrevenue and drives economic growth will decrease as they can visit other places that don’t\nimpose these risks.\nThe role of externalities in this article clearly shows how the market on its own struggled\nto find an efficient outcome.

      "essay": "Hello, Econ 101 Classmate,\nI'm just reaching out to address your confusion regarding market failure and negative\nexternalities in class this week. I heard from Professor Dudley that you are unsure. There's no\nrush to respond, especially considering everything you're dealing with. Whenever you're ready,\nI'm here to assist you with understanding market failure and anything else related to our class.\nBefore providing specific examples of negative externalities, it is essential to understand\nthem as a general concept. As defined in the class, a negative externality (cost external from the\nmarket) is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Negative\nexternalities result in market failure because the Social Marginal Cost (Producer marginal cost\n(supply curve) + external marginal cost) is higher than the Supply curve, but consumers and\nproducers in the market act as though the negative externality does not exist. Given their stagnant\nbehavior, the market equilibrium fails to account for the negative externality, resulting in the\nmarket not generating as much total surplus as possible. When externalities appear in a market,\nmarket equilibrium and market efficiency are no longer synonymous, as previously assumed in\nprevious lectures. With negative externalities, the market equilibrium results in too many units of\nthe good compared to the efficient level. The efficient level is where the society's total net gain is\nmaximized. It can be found at the intersection of the social marginal benefit curve (in this case,\nthe regular demand curve, as there are no positive externalities to add to the consumer marginal\nbenefit) and the social marginal cost curve.\nIn this New Y ork Times article, I linked here and below, a negative externality is present\nin the chemical market. The article's topic revolves around the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) proposing new rules, what we would define in this class as environmental standards on the\nmarket for goods/services to regulate certain chemicals due to their potential contribution to\nclimate change, wildfires, and floods. The market failure being identified in this context is the\nexternality caused by the negative impacts of certain chemicals on the environment, which\nimpose costs on society that are not reflected in the market price of the chemicals. This type of\nmarket failure is classified as a negative externality. In this case, the negative externality is the\nenvironmental damage and associated costs of producing and using certain chemicals not borne\nby the producers or consumers. Graphically, the potential negative impact of certain chemicals\nwould be the external marginal cost. However, like any market with a negative externality, the\nchemical market will continue ignoring negative externality, limiting the total surplus. It will not\nbe until the adoption of the EPA's rules that the market will reach efficiency and maximize total\nsurplus. There is more on negative externalities and market failures.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I understand that the concept of market failure has been difficult to understand, so I want to clarify it by focusing on a recent example highlighted in The Wall Street Journal. \nMarket failure is when the free market is left alone and fails to distribute resources efficiently, leading to social welfare loss. Externalities are a common cause of market failure, occurring when third parties are adversely affected by unaccounted for costs or benefits. These externalities can be positive or negative, but negative externalities often lead to market inefficiencies.\nA negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others, as described in the article, \"Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance, Is Health Insurance Next?\" from The Wall Street Journal. This article explains that fire damages are not paid by those causing climate change but by homeowners through higher insurance prices. \nThe article describes a classic case of negative externality. In addition to carbon emissions from industries, vehicles, and deforestation, other activities contribute to climate change. As a result, these actions come with broader societal costs, like increased wildfire risks, that don't show up in the prices of the goods and services they produce. Therefore, the true cost of these goods and services is higher than what is paid for them, leading to overconsumption and increased carbon emissions.\nThere is a huge impact on the insurance market. This situation has resulted in a sharp increase in home insurance prices and insurers withdrawing from the California market as a direct result of these wildfires. It is clear from this scenario that there has been a market failure as homeowners and insurance companies are left to deal with the financial consequences of climate change, a cost to which they did not contribute. The market fails to take into account the true cost of climate risks, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources where insurance prices do not accurately reflect the risk of wildfires.\nA market failure in this context is the difference between the private costs paid by homeowners and insurers and the social costs associated with climate change. Because the external costs of climate change are not internalized into the decision-making processes of those who contribute to carbon emissions, the market does not naturally correct this inefficiency.\nThis example shows how externalities, particularly negative ones, can lead to market failures. Consequently, interventions are necessary in order to correct these inefficiencies and realign market outcomes with social welfare. To reduce the effect of climate change and other environmental challenges, it is crucial to understand how externalities and market failure are related.\nI hope I helped you understand the concept of market failure and its relevance to current environmental and economic challenges. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.\n\nWord Count: 471\n\n\nWork Cited\nClimate Change Has Hit Home Insurance.

      "essay": "Subject: Understanding Market Failure through Concrete's Environmental Impact\nHey friend!\nI hope you are doing well and everything is okay with your family emergency. I am\nemailing you today to talk about market failure since I know you are confused with its concept. I\nfound an article from The Wall Street Journal titled, “Concrete Is One of the World’s Worst\nPollutants. Making It Green Is a Booming Business,” that will help me explain everything you\nneed to know.\nSince you already know a lot about microeconomics, let’s start off by understanding what\nit means for a market to fail. This occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome,\neven in equilibrium (absent any intervention). This inefficiency can happen due to various\nreasons, but the one I’m going to talk to you about in this email is externalities. Externalities are\nthe side effects of production or consumption that affect people that aren’t directly involved in\nthe economic transaction. These effects can be either positive or negative. A positive externality\nis a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation, and a\nnegative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others.\nThe article I researched for you talks about a specific market failure that is an\nexample of a negative externality. It discusses how concrete production, specifically cement, is a\nhuge contributor to global carbon emissions, accounting for more than 7% of the total amount.\nSince the cost of environmental damage caused by this concrete production is passed onto\nsociety as a whole without being borne by the producers of it, it is a perfect example.\nThis negative externality arises because the producers of this concrete don’t consider the\ndamage and environmental costs of their actions when determining the price of their product. As\na result, they may overproduce this concrete because they don’t bear the full cost of it, which can\nlead to an overallocation of resources towards its production. This ultimately creates a socially\ninefficient economy.\nHowever, the article also talks about some positive developments aimed at addressing\nthis market failure that are important to mention. Entrepreneurs and investors, including Bill\nGates and Jeff Bezos, are investing in technologies to produce \"greener\" concrete with lower\ncarbon emissions. These innovations are using alternative materials for cement production, such\nas rocks with no carbon content, and capturing carbon emissions from the air during production.\nDespite this, there are still ongoing challenges to this adoption of greener concrete. Building\ncodes often require specific concrete compositions, making it difficult for new materials to enter\nthe market, and the cost is a huge factor because these alternatives tend to be very expensive.\nOverall, the article illustrates how market failure, specifically the negative externality of\nenvironmental damage from concrete production, can lead to inefficiencies in resource\nallocation. I hope this explanation clarifies market failure for you and let me know if there is\nanything else I can do to help!\nBest,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 494\nWorks Cited\nConcrete Is One of the World’ s Worst Pollutants.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\n        I hope you and your family are doing well, I understand how stressful and difficult it can be to balance family matters and school. I know you have been doing a great job this semester in our Econ 101 course, but for you to keep up I’d love to help you have a better understanding of what we’ve been learning about in class, in particular the concept of market failure. As you know, markets achieve equilibrium when the quantity consumers demand of a good or service is equal to the supply of said good or service, and markets always work towards reaching and maintaining this equilibrium. However, markets aren’t always perfect, and certain factors can prevent markets from reaching equilibrium. This is where market failure sometimes comes in—when the market is inefficient and does not allocate goods and services efficiently. \n        Although many different factors can lead to market failure, I’m going to focus on explaining the concept of negative externalities, an extremely common cause of market failure. Negative externalities are uncompensated costs imposed on third parties caused by the production or consumption of a service or good of an individual or firm. The imposition on the third party then leads to negative effects on the market, causing market failure. A common example of negative externalities is pollution caused by production or consumption, as it affects a third party, the world, and in turn, negatively affects the market supplying the good. To help illustrate this concept, I have picked out an article from the U.S. News about oil and gas production: https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-02-13/oil-and-gas-producer-to-pay-millions-to-us-and-new-mexico-to-remedy-pollution-concerns. \nThe article reports on a settlement reached by Apache Corporation with the federal government and the state of New Mexico, aiming to address air pollution issues in the Permian Basin, the largest oil and gas-producing region in the United States. Apache Corporation agreed to pay $4 million in penalties and spend over $5 million on preventive measures to reduce emissions. The market failure in this example results from Apache Corporation's oil and gas operations, as these operations have led to significant air pollution, including emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to environmental degradation and public health issues in surrounding communities. This pollution from the corporation's operations imposes costs on third parties, i.e. the environment and public health, that aren’t reflected in the company's operational costs or the price of oil and gas, showing how this is an example of a negative externality. Furthermore, the fact that Apache Corporation plans on paying penalties and investing in reducing emissions shows how they are trying to aid their own market reach equilibrium and negate the effects of the negative externalities that have caused inefficiencies in the market. \nI hope that this example helps you understand what negative externalities are, how they affect markets, and what can be done to try and counteract the negative effects of these externalities on the markets. Best wishes to you and your family, I hope to see you back on campus soon!\n\nBest,\nYour friend\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI am writing to you to help you understand the concept of market failure better.\nMarket failure refers to situations where the consumer demand does not equal the amount of a\ngood or service supplied (Dudley). This can be a result of external factors such as externalities,\npublic goods, and common resources. There are two types of externalities. A negative externality\nis an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. On the other hand, a\npositive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving\ncompensation (Dudley). An example of this would be education as students benefit from this\nfirm, but the school does not receive compensation. Another external factor is public goods.\nPublic goods can be excludable or a rival in consumption. When a good is excludable, it means\nthat a supplier can prevent people who do not pay from consuming the good. When a good is a\nrival in consumption, it means the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one\nperson at the same time.\nTo clearly illustrate the concept of market failure, I am going to reference an article published by\nthe Wall Street Journal. The article’s topic is about electric cars and how they emit more\nparticulate pollution because they have greater tire wear. In the article, electric cars are identified\nas a market failure because they are negatively affecting the environment as a result of their\nactivity (Electric). As a result, this type of market failure is classified as a negative externality. A\nnegative externality, also known as an external cost, is an uncompensated cost that an individual\nor firm imposes on others (Dudley). The market failure of electric vehicles is a negative\nexternality as they make air pollution worse, but don’t bear the cost from doing so. As we\nlearned earlier in the semester, equilibrium is the price at which quantity supplied is equal to the\nquantity demanded, which is what all markets aim for. However, negative externalities don't\nallow the market equilibrium to generate as much total surplus. This is because negative\nexternalities cause the market equilibrium to result in too many units of a good compared to the\nefficient level (Dudley). Environmental standards, emissions taxes, and tradable emission permits\nare three common mechanisms that can be put in place to reduce negative externalities. When\ntrying to be cost efficient, emission taxes and tradable emission permits are the best mechanisms\nto use as emission taxes place a tax on the quantity of pollution emitted, and tradable emission\npermits will require licenses to limit the quantities of pollutants that are bought and sold by\npolluters. Environmental standards will also reduce negative externalities as they are rules that\nspecify actions by producers and consumers placed in order to protect the environment.\nReferring to the article, California plans to pursue efficiency of the negative externality of\npollution emitted from electric vehicles by a production quota. This means they plan to limit the\nquantities of electric vehicles knowing that it will reduce the negative externality of pollution.\nI hope this email clears up any confusion you may have about market failure.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nWorks Cited\n24, M.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment #3: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\n        While you were absent, we covered the concept of market failure in Economics class. In simplest terms, market failure is when the resources in a market are inefficiently distributed or used. Graphically, this would be seen when the equilibrium point is different from the efficient point, which creates deadweight loss. Oftentimes, the  efficient quantity/price can be seen due to the presence of a social marginal cost/benefit curve; these are the additional cost or benefit incurred by society by producing an additional unit of the good in question, and they are either seen below the supply or demand curves. There are several concepts that can contribute to and cause market failure, such as externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. One such concept, in particular negative externalities, is a prevalent cause of market failure and can be seen in real life examples. An externality is an uncompensated cost or benefit that an individual or a firm imposes on others, usually an uninvolved third party. This can be seen in a real life example in the Wall Street Journal article “Electric Cars Emit More Particulate Pollution” by Michael Buschbacher and Taylor Myers. In this article, the authors describe how electric vehicles in California may be deceptive in their marketing and how they may not be as environmentally friendly as described. Specifically, small tire-wear particles that are emitted during use are shown to be as detrimental as exhaust emissions. In fact, “Electric cars weigh far more than gasoline-powered ones, so their tires degrade faster”, causing more emissions than even some gasoline powered cars (Buschbacher and Myers). This illustrates the effects of a negative externality when uninvolved third parties are factored in; for example, people who live in the areas in which these electric car drivers commute through. They had no involvement in the production or consumption of these vehicles, but they may have to bear the health effects of being exposed to this pollution. In a market sense, experts may calculate the cost that these emissions have on society at a dollar value, which is known as the external marginal cost. This cost is factored into the supply and demand of the market and forms a curve above the supply curve known as social marginal cost (SMC). It is important to note that the efficient point in this market is where this SMC intersects with demand, or social marginal benefit. This efficient quantity will be below the equilibrium one because society produced too many of these electric cars and needs to scale back to properly compensate for the harm done. As a reminder, this indicates market failure as the current equilibrium price is not the efficient one. This can best be resolved with a tax, which will help the market reach this efficient point. I hope that this example was able to help clarify the concept of externalities and market failure and that you have a good understanding of the topic now.\n\nBest,\nAnonymous\n\nWord Count: 493\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBuschbacher, Michael, and Taylor Myers. “Electric Cars Emit More Particulate Matter.” Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones, 3 Mar. 2024, www.wsj.com/articles/electric-cars-emit-more-soot-california-ban-gas-powered-vehicles-521b29e3.\n\n",

      "essay": "1\nSubject line: Explaining Market Failure\nDear classmate,\nHello! I hope your time home was valuable in some way. During your absence we\ncovered Market Failures. Market failures can be defined as instances in the free market which\ncause an inefficient allocation of resources. There are four types of market failures, grouped as\nfollows: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods and Artificially Scarce Goods.\nExternalities occur when an interaction takes place between a producer and consumer, causing an\nunrelated third party to be affected. More specifically, there are two types of externalities. There\nare positive and negative externalities. A positive externality benefits the third party, while a\nnegative externality harms the unrelated group.\nI have chosen to provide commentary on an article published this past February, which\ndetails a real life Negative Externality. The article is titled: “Don’ t Build That E-Commerce\nWarehouse In My Backyard,” By Peter Grant. Online shopping has practically become a\nsubstitute for in person retail due to the convenience. Consequently, there is a significant need\nfor spaces to manufacture the goods that are being ordered. The warehouses are built as a result\nof the business relationships between developers and retailers. Those who negotiate building\npermits, design/acquire factory space, operate within their market. This interaction, which\ndirectly causes the manufacturing, is external to the residents of the city where centers are built.\nHowever, this activity is creating a negative externality to residents near the factories. Large,\nindustrial structure is fundamentally incongruent with the aesthetic of a family friendly, perhaps\naffluent neighborhood. Grant writes of the current situation, detailing certain communities'\n2\nresponses to the trend: “Some governments are blocking distribution centers partly because they\nare running out of land for commercial purposes. They want to attract high-salaried office jobs to\nthe sites, rather than logistics developments that pay lower wages and make smaller contributions\nto tax revenues”(Grant). Specifically, the Marginal Social Cost (MSC) exceeds the Marginal\nPrivate Cost (MPC). The MSC is representative of how each unit produced of a given good\nnegatively affects society. The MPC is the producer's cost of creating each additional unit. For a\nNegative Externality, the efficient quantity and price should be less than the market point, and\nthis discrepancy (Negative total surplus) is representative of deadweight loss. In this case, the\ncommunity uproar is representative of that inefficiency. Furthermore, the discrepancy is\ngraphically represented, illustrating distance between the optimal point (socially efficient point),\nand market state. The area between the MSC and the MPC, is the Marginal External Cost.\nGraphically, fills in the leftward (negative) space between the MSC, and MPC to showcase the\ninefficiency. The MEC is the added cost (negative externality), which occurs from the creation of\none additional warehouse for example. Lastly, the curves intersect with the Marginal Social\nBenefit curve. This curve indicates how one additional unit of production of the good, benefits\nsociety. The efficient quantity is further leftward along the MSB, than the market point. Again,\nproviding a way to visualize the negative societal impact, paired with the economic principles.\nWork Cited\n3\nDon’ t Build That e-Commerce Warehouse in My Backyard ...,\nwww.wsj.com/business/logistics/dont-build-that-e-commerce-warehouse-in-my-backyard-more-\ncommunities-say-5e35625a.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI’ve written down some notes for you on the concepts we discussed in lecture when you\nwere gone. We discussed market failure this week. Market failure refers to a situation where the\nallocation of goods and services by the market is not efficient, leading to loss in a net social gain.\nV arious factors can disrupt this efficient market, resulting in outcomes that can cause failures\nfrom a societal viewpoint. These failures are generally categorized into several types:\nexternalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nTo help you understand this intricate concept, I’ve searched for an article that can help\nme explain the concept more effectively. This article discusses a pressing issue in the U.S.\nchildcare market, highlighting it as a classic example of market failure. This particular case of\nmarket failure can be examined through the lens of several economic concepts: externalities and\npublic goods.\nFirst, let's talk about externalities. An externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party\nwho did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. The childcare industry is riddled with positive\nexternalities; for instance, high-quality childcare services provide societal benefits that extend\nbeyond the immediate families involved. These benefits include better educational outcomes for\nchildren, higher future earnings, and reduced crime rates. However, because these benefits are\nnot captured in the market price of childcare, providers may underinvest in quality, or parents\nmay under consume these services relative to the socially optimal level.\nSecond, consider the concept of public goods. Public goods are goods that are\nnon-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that no one can be excluded from using them, and\none person's use does not reduce availability to others. While childcare services themselves are\nnot public goods, the benefits of a well-educated and cared child population bear characteristics\nof public goods. The broader societal benefits of high-quality childcare underscore the argument\nfor more significant public investment and involvement in the childcare sector.\nThe article describes a scenario where the COVID-19 exacerbated the structural problems\nin the childcare market. The support by federal funds temporarily kept many childcare centers to\nsurvive, but as this support expired as the pandemic era came to an end, inflation and costs\nsoared, pushing the industry to the brink. Additionally, changes in work habits from the\npandemic have led to decreased demand for childcare services resulting in the failure of a\nsystem.\nThe childcare market in the U.S. is failing because it doesn't account for the externalities\nand the public good nature of childcare services. The result is a market where suppliers struggle\nto stay open due to financial pressures, and consumers find it increasingly difficult to afford high\nquality childcare. This situation leads to an underprovision of a service that is crucial for\nchildren's development and has significant implications for the economy and society at large.\nI hope the examples from the article helped you understand the concepts better. If you\nhave any more questions, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope everything is going fine.\nWork count: 507\nWork cited: Grose, J. (2024, March 13).

      "essay": "Hey Tom,\nSorry to hear about your mom, but I’m glad she’s doing better now! As for your question\nabout market failure, I’ll do my best to explain it. I’ll first point out that there’s a distinction\nbetween a market’s equilibrium point and its efficient outcome. The market’s efficient outcome\noccurs when total surplus is maximized, which may not necessarily occur at market equilibrium.\nA market fails when it can’t reach this efficient outcome barring intervention. This market failure\ncan occur as the result of various factors, including externalities and public goods. Externalities\nare costs or benefits affecting people not directly involved in the exchange of goods in a market\n(Dudley,\n“Externalities” slide 4). Market equilibrium fails to account for these externalities,\nresulting in the market not generating as much total surplus as possible and failing to be socially\nefficient.\nThere are several types of goods that also lead to market failure. These goods can be\nclassified according to the attributes of excludability and rivalry in consumption. Excludable\ngoods require consumers to pay for those goods to use them. Goods that are rival in consumption\ncan’t be consumed by multiple people at the same time. A good that is both excludable and rival\nin consumption, namely a private good, can be efficiently allocated by the market. However,\ngoods that are either non-excludable or non-rival in consumption will create market failure.\nSpecifically, a non-excludable good will encounter the free rider problem, in which consumers\ncan benefit from the good without paying for it (Dudley, “Public Goods…,\n” slide 7). These\ngoods are typically underproduced because producers can’t charge for the benefits received by\nnon-paying consumers (Ensmov). Thus, society misses out on goods that would have been\nbeneficial if provided at the optimal level. A good that is non-rival in consumption will also\ncause market failure because the efficient price of such a good is often zero, which is\nunsustainable for producers.\nTo help illustrate market failure, I’ve attached an article called “How America’s Diet Is\nFeeding the Groundwater Crisis,\n” which discusses how America’s increased consumption of\nchicken and cheese recently has taken a toll on groundwater supplies. These dietary shifts have\nled to farmers growing more animal feed, like soybeans and alfalfa, which are very water-\nintensive crops, to feed the chickens and cows required to produce chicken and cheese (Flavelle).\nThe resulting groundwater depletion can damage buildings, roads, or other structures through the\nformation of sinkholes in places of heavy groundwater withdrawal (EPA). In this market,\ngroundwater is a common resource, which is a good that’s both non-excludable and rival in\nconsumption (Dudley,\n“Public Goods…,\n” slide 11). The potential for sinkhole formation is an\nexternal cost associated with the use of this good, creating a negative impact on society.\nTherefore, the social marginal cost of using this resource is higher than the private marginal cost,\nresulting in an efficient quantity that is lower than the equilibrium quantity. To achieve\nefficiency, the government can reduce the consumption of groundwater supplies by assigning\nproperty rights or creating tradeable licenses to limit the amount of water-intensive agriculture\nfarmers are allowed to engage in (Dudley, “Public Goods…,\n” slide 12).\nHope this helps and let me know if you have any more questions!\nKobi\nBody Word Count: 499\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities” Economics 101, 5 Mar. 2024.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\tI am very sorry to hear about your family emergency, and I hope all is well. I understand that you may have some confusion with the concept of market failures, so I can certainly assist you! We learned in class that a market failure occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome and the total surplus is not maximized (Dudley). A market failure results in some type of deadweight loss due to an inefficient allocation of resources. Overall, the market prefers to operate at efficient equilibrium as you know, and market failure doesn’t allow this to happen. \n\tAn article in the New York Times includes an example of a market failure which may assist you in understanding the concept. This article, which is linked at the end of this email, speaks about a chemical plant, Chemours, in North Carolina that has been dumping facility wastewater into the Cape Fear River for decades. The wastewater makes the river unsafe to drink from or swim in for over 100 miles away (Tabuchi). This situation is an example of a negative market externality, which is a source of market failure. An externality, when negative for the market, is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others (Dudley). In the case of the Chemours chemical facility, the uncompensated cost lands on a third party: the people and communities who live near the Cape Fear River within 100 miles from Chemours since they’re unable to safely drink the water or swim in it. \n\tThis negative externality presents itself as an additional external marginal cost that should be added to Chemours’ marginal cost, accounting for the incurred cost on the people who live near Chemours and the Cape Fear River. The external marginal cost plus Chemours’ marginal cost creates a new leftward-shifted supply line called social marginal cost, and the intersection of this line with the demand line is the true efficient market. However, since the negative effects of dumping wastewater into the river isn’t technically taken into account, or internalized, by Chemours, the market continues to operate at an inefficient level, failing to produce as much total surplus as possible and creating a deadweight loss. \n\tChemours could take the wastewater issue into account and move the market toward an efficient equilibrium by either targeting the externality or the market (Dudley). For instance, targeting the externality could include a tax on the amount of wastewater dumped. Or, targeting the market could involve a production quota where the quantity of good that Chemours produces is limited to reduce the effect of the wastewater dump. Either way, the negative externality must be acknowledged and reduced to remove the market failure and move to an efficient equilibrium.\n\tI hope the example I referenced with Chemours chemical facility and the externality, or market failure, that they create by negatively affecting Cape Fear River residents helps you understand the workings of a market failure.

      "essay": "Hello dear friend of mine,\nThanks for reaching out to me about market failures. Professor Dudley went over quite a\nbit on what market failures are, and the examples. I will gladly help you with understanding what\na market failure is, and the different kinds of failures that can occur. If you can understand what a\nmarket failure is, then you should be able to see them all around.\nIn lecture Professor Dudley explained that a market failure is when a market is not at a\nmost efficient level in terms of the distribution of goods and services. Generally this can lead to a\nloss of economic value in the market. In lecture the professor talked about four kinds of market\nfailures: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods.\nTo understand Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods market\nfailures you must understand the concept of market exclusion, and rivalry. Exclusion means that\nthe provider of a good or service can decide who does, or does not have access to it, while\nnon-exclusion means they cannot control this. Rivalry means that only one entity can consume a\ngiven good or service at a time or that it can only be consumed once.\nAn Externality is when an unrelated party of a given transaction is affected some way by\nthe transaction. Externality market failures can be both positive and negative. For instance a\nnegative externality could be some factory generating pollution. The people nearby to the\npollution are negatively affected by this, even though they are not related to it. A positive\nexternality could be the rise of electric vehicles leading to a more climate friendly form of\ntransportation. The article attached (Joselow) mentions how the National US government is\nenacting a rule on automakers to increase the amount of sales of electric vehicles and to reduce\nthe carbon emissions from their gasoline-powered models. This would have a positive effect on\neveryone due to its impact on the climate, even though a large majority of people are not related\nto the market.\nA public goods deals with a non-excludable, non-rival good or service. This market can\nfail because private companies have little incentive to provide the goods or service due to the\nlack of being able to make a profit. Usually governments provide goods and services instead, for\nexample public roads.\nA common resource involves goods and services that are non-excludable but have a rival\nconsumption. This market can fail due to the difficulties in being able to prevent\noverconsumption or complete depletion of it. An example of a common resource could include\nstudy spaces in the library.\nFinally artificially scarce goods are goods and services that are excludable but non-rival.\nThis could include a subscription to a streaming service. A failure could be that the resource isn’t\ndistributed as efficiently as it could be.\nHopefully this helps!

      "essay": "Good evening my dear friend,\n\nI’m writing to you to explain the concept of a market failure in economics and provide an example that might help you better understand the topic.\n \nTo begin, a market failure is when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome, which is when the total surplus is maximized, without interventions such as taxes and quotas, even if the market appears to be in equilibrium. (Dudley) A market failure can be caused by different factors or by understanding the type of good/service being transacted. Two of the simplest that I’ve come to understand are positive and negative externalities. An externality is an external benefit (positive) or cost (negative) that is imposed on a third party (individual, company, country, etc.). Externalities cause the market to fail because in the case of a negative externality, the market equilibrium may result in too many units of the good, while a positive externality may result in too few units of the good being produced compared to the efficient level. (Dudley)\n\nMarket failures can also be caused by certain types of goods/services being transacted. Goods and services can be classified into four categories: private goods, artificially scarce goods, public goods, and common resources. When we typically think about market transactions, we normally think of private goods: goods that have a price, meaning they are excludable, and can only be consumed by one person at a time, meaning they are rival in consumption. Examples of these would be a smartphone or house. (Dudley) The three other goods have a combination of those two characteristics. Artifically scarce goods, while excludable like private goods meaning they have a price, are non-rival in consumption, meaning multiple people can enjoy it at once. Examples include cable television and intellectual property. Common resources and public goods are both non-excludable, so no price, but common resources are rival in consumption while public goods are non-rival in consumption. In each case, besides private goods, there is a market failure because the market fails to efficiently allocate the good. (Dudley)\n\nI’d like to introduce you to this article written by The New York Times that provides an example of a market failure. (Landler) The article describes how an LED sphere similar to the one recently opened in Las Vegas, NV, was in the works for London. After years of planning, investors have decided that it is not in their best interest to build the sphere. One of the biggest reasons for this is the negative externality that it imposes on residents. Remember, a negative externality is an external cost put on a third party, in this case the residents. The external cost in this case would be the adverse effects from having a gigantic, LED-glowing ball right next to London. Many residents have expressed resentment for the idea as it could create a negative view of the area because of increased traffic from tourists, increases in anxiety, and perhaps result in residents leaving the area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord Count: 486\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities.” ECON 101, 05 March 2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nMarket failure is the situation that occurs when a market fails to be inefficient. Market\nfailure is caused by the individual pursuit of one’s own interest, instead of promoting the\ninterests of society as a whole. Often, the cause of market failure lies in externalities An\nexternality is a side effect of an activity that affects bystanders whose interests aren’t taken into\naccount. An externality can be positive or negative. A negative externality is an activity whose\nside effects harm bystanders while a positive externality is an activity whose side effects benefit\nbystanders. In the case of a negative externality, market failure ensues because individuals do not\ntake into account the effect that an activity has on the rest of society, and thus they do more of\nthis activity than they would if their goal was to produce the most efficient outcome. For positive\nexternalities, people often do not take into account the positive effect that an activity has on the\nrest of the society, and thus they do less of this activity than they would if their goals was to\nproduce the most efficient outcome. In both cases, market failure is the result.\nFor an apt example of market failure caused by externalities, we can look to the market\nfor coal. Coal is produced from mining, and this mining often leads to pollution. Perhaps the\nmost consequential pollutant of coal mining is mercury. In a recent article from The New York\nTimes, it is discussed how the mercury that was put into the environment decades ago from\nactivities such as coal mining is still present, particularly in Tuna. It is stated that despite a\nmassive reduction in mercury pollution, mercury levels in tuna samples remained virtually\nunchanged from 1971 to 2022 (Hiroko). Mercury pollution can be categorized as a negative\nexternality in coal mining and one that has had large costs on society. This negative externality is\na cause for market failure in the coal mining industry, and the market failure stems from the fact\nthat coal producers were not taking into account the costs exacted on society as a whole when\ndeciding how much coal to produce, and they were thus producing more coal than was optimal\nfor society. Mercury pollution can lead to mercury poisoning and can cause severe disease in\nthose exposed to it. This in turn exacts large costs on society as treatments must be developed\nand patients must be cared for. If the coal producing company took these costs into account, they\nwould have produced less coal. Thus, the efficient quantity of coal produced, is less than what\nwas actually being produced, and society is still paying for this today.\nSincerely,\nYour friend\nWord Count: 445\nBibliography\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Why Is Mercury Stubbornly High in Tuna?

      "essay": "Hey [friend]!\nHope everything is okay at home. Here’s what we went over in econ 101 re market failures!\nA market failure occurs when a market fails to maximize efficiency, regardless of any\nintervention.\nThere are a couple different kinds of market failures: externalities, common resources,\npublic goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nExternalities can either be negative or positive. A negative externality occurs when an\nindividual or firm imposes a cost on others without compensation (I’ll link an example of\nthis at the bottom of this email). A positive externality occurs when a benefit is reaped from\nan individual or firm by somebody who didn’t pay for it (like when most people are\nvaccinated, everybody experiences herd immunity).\nCommon resources are non-excludable and rival in consumption. This means that the\nsupplier of the resource can’t prevent somebody who didn’t pay for the good from using it.\nIt also means that a unit of the good can’t be consumed by more than one person at the\nsame time. Because anybody can use the good, but nobody else can once it’s been used, the\nsocial marginal cost is higher than the private marginal cost. The efficient quantity of the\ngood is found where social marginal cost meets demand, but because most consumers are\nmotivated by an understanding of private marginal cost, the equilibrium quantity falls\nbelow the efficient quantity.\nPublic goods are non-excludable, like common resources, but they’re non-rival in\nconsumption. This means that a unit of the good can be used by multiple people at the same\ntime. The social marginal benefit of the good is the sum of the private benefit garnered by\nall the show’s listeners. Efficient quantity comes when social marginal benefit equals\nmarginal cost. However , because not everybody who consumes the good will pay for it, the\ngood will not be produced as often as it could be if everybody who benefitted from it paid.\nThis means that the quantity of the good produced and consumed is lower than the efficient\nquantity.\nArtificially scarce goods are excludable but non-rival in consumption. This means that the\nproducer of the good can prevent non-payers from consuming it, but an infinite number of\npeople can consume it at the same time. Because the good is non-rival, the efficient price is\nzero. However , the producer wants to profit off of the good, so the price they charge will be\ngreater than zero, and thus inefficient.\nHere’s an article I found with a real-world example of a negative externality: North Carolina\n‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N. Panel Says - The New York Times.\nWe can see that the people drinking water from the Cape Fear river in North Carolina, who\nare neither producers nor consumers of the Chemours plant’s technologies, are being\nharmed by the production of those technologies without compensation.\nHope this helps!

      "essay": "Friend,\nI hope you are doing well considering your unexpected family emergency. I am more\nthan happy to help you understand the concept of a market failure as we have learned thus far in\nECON 101.\nA market failure occurs when a market fails to be efficient, even in equilibrium. A market\ncan be in equilibrium, but not efficient if it fails to maximize total surplus. Maximum total\nsurplus tells us societies possible maximum net gain from the market, which is reached when the\nmarginal benefit intersects marginal cost. We can measure and identify market failure by\nmeasuring the difference between the identified total surplus at equilibrium and the efficient\noutcome. Market failures can occur due to externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods.\nThis article I found from The Wall Street Journal, \"Global CO2 Emissions Hit Record\nHigh in 2023, IEA says,\" by Giulia Petroni, is helpful in analyzing a specific market failure. The\narticle highlights concerns regarding the increased global carbon dioxide emissions in 2023.\nWhile the U.S. and Europe took steps toward renewable sources, India and China took steps\nback, relying on fossil fuels as their main source of electricity to replace hydropower. This article\nshows a market failure in regards to the substitution of fossil fuels as an energy source in India\nand China, leading to increase in carbon dioxide emissions globally. China and India negatively\nimpacted the globe as a whole with their increased carbon dioxide emissions, caused by\ninefficient energy sourcing (2024).\nWe can identify a market failure here, specifically a negative externality. A negative\nexternality is a cost that is paid by an uninvolved third party when buyers and sellers are\ninteracting in a market. In this article, the external cost that is present is the pollution due to\ncarbon dioxide emissions.\nThis increase in fossil fuel use for energy production caused the International Energy\nAgency to step in to assist with economic development and increased investment in renewable\nenergy sources (Petroni, 2024). The government could create rules that limit the amount of\ncarbon dioxide emissions, place taxes on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted, or create\nemission permits to limit the amount of pollution. In terms of the market, the government can\nstep in by creating technology requirements for the process of electricity production, taxing\nelectricity overall, or putting in place a production quota to limit the amount of pollution.\nOverall, this issue is in need of action to improve as it affects the good of the global economy,\nhumans, and the environment.\nThe negative externality of carbon dioxide emissions prevents the market from being\nsocially efficient as there are too many units of the good being produced when compared to the\nefficient level, and total surplus is not maximized. Though in this example, outsiders are\nexperiencing an external cost, externalities are not always negative. Positive externalities can do\nthe opposite of this scenario, as consumer and producer interactions create a positive impact on\noutsiders.\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any more questions I can try to help\nwith.\nBest,\nY our ECON 101 classmate.\nWord Count: 492\nReferences:\nPetroni, G.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nFirst Draft\n\nHi __________,\nI hope everything is well with your family, and I’m glad to help you understand the concept of market failure. A market failure occurs when the market equilibrium produces an inefficient outcome. An efficient market maximizes total surplus, while an inefficient market fails to reach this maximum.\nHere’s an example: the attached article identifies groundwater depletion as a primary cause of rising sea levels along the East Coast (Rojanasakul & Hernandez, 2024). A market failure occurs due to negative externalities caused by the overuse of groundwater.\nGroundwater is a common resource, thus being non-excludable and rival in consumption. This means that it is consumable and accessible to everyone, but individual consumption reduces the total amount available. Simply put, groundwater is a shared resource that can be depleted by overconsumption. \nGroundwater depletion causes sea levels to rise, which produces adverse effects including increased flood hazards, storm surge risks, and significant damage to coastal structures (Rojanasakul & Hernandez, 2024). These unintended consequences are called negative externalities because they negatively affect society altogether, besides just consumers and suppliers of groundwater. These externalities are measured by external marginal costs.\nBy failing to account for external marginal costs, the groundwater market equilibrium does not maximize total surplus. Thus far in class, we assumed consumers, producers, and the government to be the only participants in the market model, where the supply and demand curves represent the producer marginal cost and consumer marginal benefit. To accurately reflect the real-world, we must consider externalities affecting all others. Consequently, the social marginal cost is the sum of the producer marginal cost and external marginal costs, and the social marginal benefit is the sum of the consumer marginal cost and external marginal benefits. Whereas market equilibrium occurs where supply and demand intersect, market efficiency occurs at the intersection of social marginal cost and social marginal benefit. At this point, society’s net gain, or total surplus, is maximized.\nBack to the article’s example: without accounting for the external marginal cost of groundwater use, the supply curve does not reflect the true social marginal cost of groundwater with negative externalities. This means that the current market quantity of water is inefficiently high while the market price is inefficiently low. Government intervention can reduce negative externalities by regulating groundwater exchange. For example, price floors and taxes levied on groundwater suppliers can raise the price of water to reflect the marginal social cost, therefore reducing consumption. Additionally, quotas can limit the quantity of groundwater consumed. \nOverall, market failure happens when the market does not maximize total welfare in equilibrium, resulting in inefficiency. As the article demonstrates, market failure can be caused by negative externalities, due to external marginal costs (i.e adverse effects of depleting groundwater), and overconsumption of a common resource.\nLet me know if you still have questions. I’m happy to clarify any other confusion in ECON 101 as you figure things out with your family.\nBest,\n__________\nWord Count: 476\nReference\nRojanasakul, M., & Hernandez, M. (2024, February 14).

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI understand that you’re confused about market failures so I will explain to the best of my\nability. Put simply, a market fails when it does not reach the efficient outcome so it does not\nmaximize total surplus. A market at equilibrium does not mean it is at efficiency (Dudley). One\ntype of market failure is a negative externality, which means that the interaction of the consumers\nand producers in the market has a negative effect on an unrelated third party.\nA simple example of an externality is pollution. In Indonesia, a ban was implemented on\nthe export of raw nickel, a resource used in electric vehicle batteries, which is a growing\nindustry. This meant that countries hoping to import Indonesia’s nickel would have to set up\nnickel smelteries in Indonesia. While successful in boosting the economies of areas in Indonesia\nrich in nickel as well as the industry itself, the furnaces that smelt nickel had to be powered\nsomehow. This power source was coal, a fossil fuel that contributes to pollution (Emont). In this\nexample, we have the market for smelted nickel. The two parties interacting in this market are\nthe producer- Indonesia, and consumer- other countries who want to import Indonesia’s nickel\nfor EV batteries. The unintended consequence, or negative externality, in this exchange is the\npollution that results from the coal used to power the smelteries. By not taking the cost of\nharming the environment into consideration, the market equilibrium does not accurately reflect\nall the costs and benefits in the exchange (“How Do Externalities”). The efficient outcome will\ntake the externality into consideration and will be at the intersection of the Social Marginal Cost\nand the Demand curves, putting it at a higher price and lower quantity than the equilibrium to\noffset the negative effects on the third party. In this case, the price of nickel would increase and\nquantity would decrease.\nThere are a few ways to regulate this pollution.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\nHope you’re doing well. Let me help you catch up on your coursework by explaining market failure.\n\nIn general, a market failure occurs when absent of any type of intervention, the market fails to reach maximized total surplus. This means that it doesn’t reach its true equilibrium price and quantity. In an efficient, competitive market, prices and production levels are set such that the marginal social benefits, the satisfaction experienced by all consumers from another unit of a good, equal the marginal social costs, the total cost that society pays for when producing another unit. However, market failures disrupt this equilibrium, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. One of these types of failures is in the form of externalities, which is when production or consumption imposes external costs or benefits on others not accounted for in the market price. Externalities happen because producers/consumers do not bear the full costs of these externalities on society, so they tend to over-produce/over-consume more than the socially optimal level, leading to an inefficient market outcome. There are negative externalities, where the full cost to society is higher than just the producer's marginal cost, implying the efficient quantity should be lower than the current level. Conversely, positive externalities occur when demand exceeds the accounted amount due to an external marginal benefit, so the efficient quantity should be higher than the current level. If this is confusing, let me provide a recent example of an externality. \n\nIn the recent New York Times article titled \"Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns\", it discusses the growing research showing microplastics are being found inside the human body, including in our blood, lungs, and even placentas of pregnant women. It cites a one study that found patients with microplastics in their blood systems were 4.5 times more likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, or death. (Jacobs, 2024). This demonstrates a significant negative externality - the production and use of plastics by companies imposes huge external health and environmental costs on society that are not reflected in the market prices of plastic goods. Since producers don't have to pay for these externalized social costs, too much plastic is being produced and consumed relative to what would be optimal when considering all costs to society. In this case, the social marginal cost is greater than what is currently accounted for. This is the essence of a market failure due to externalities. \n\nThere are ways for the government to address this market failure. It could enact emissions taxes and tradable emissions permits like a license to produce or use plastic. These methods are the least costly way. It could also create environmental standards in the form of laws specifying actions. These methods could be done on either the externality itself, or the market of plastic. Any of these methods would increase producers’ marginal cost, accounting for the externality and decreasing the quantity to efficient equilibrium and address the market failure.\n\nHopefully this caught you up.\n\nSincerely,\nBest Friend [500]\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nJacobs, Andrew. “A New Film at SXSW Warns of the Potential Harm of Microplastics.” The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html.\n\tJacobs delves into the health implications of microplastics found in the human body, a concern illuminated in the documentary \"Plastic People.\" The identified market failure revolves around the insufficient acknowledgment of externalities in plastic production and disposal, specifically the health repercussions of microplastics. This market failure is classified as a negative externality, where the true social and environmental costs of plastic pollution, especially the health risks posed by microplastics, are not fully accounted for in market transactions. The marginal benefits from using cheap durable goods are less because of the unseen dangers it presents to the human body.\n\t\n\n",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nI am writing today to help you better understand the concept of market failure, in the hopes that\nyou can keep up with the Econ 101 course work. In essence, a market failure occurs when,\nwithout any intervention and even in equilibrium, the market fails to reach efficiency and\ntherefore does not maximize total surplus. Total surplus is the combined value that consumers\nand producers receive from market transactions. Market failure could be measured by calculating\nthe difference between the total surplus at market equilibrium and the efficient outcome.\nOne of the main sources of market failure is the presence of externalities, unintended side effects\nthat affect those not directly involved. A positive externality, also known as an external benefit,\nis a gain that an individual or firm provides a third party without receiving compensation. In this\nsituation, all the benefits that actions could have on society are not considered, so the market\nunderproduces. An example of a positive externality is how education not only benefits the\nperson directly receiving that education but also benefits society because educated individuals\nbring more economic value to a community.\nOn the other hand, a negative externality, also known as an external cost, is an uncompensated\ncost that an individual or firm imposes on an unrelated third party. In this situation, the market\noverproduces because all of the costs are not valued. An example of a negative externality could\nbe the indirect burdens faced by stakeholders as a result of initiatives aimed at reducing\npollution. In an effort to prevent numerous premature deaths each year, the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) implemented stricter regulations for power plants and factories to spew\nfine particulate matter (Friedman, 2024). However, manufacturers and 24 states sued the EPA as\na result of this rule, claiming that this would increase costs for manufacturers, utilities, and the\npublic. This situation demonstrates a negative externality within the market for goods produced\nby power plants and factories. While the EPA aimed to address public health concerns, the\nindirect burden imposed on stakeholders, such as increased costs, highlight the presence of\nmarket failure resulting from negative externalities.\nIn addition to externalities, market failure also relates to public goods, common resources, and\nartificially scarce goods. A good is excludable when the supplier of the good is able to prevent\nnonpayers from consuming that item and a good is a rival in consumption if the same unit of that\ngood cannot be consumed by multiple people at once. When goods are nonexcludable, the\nmarket will encounter the market failure of free riders, which are consumers who utilize the good\nwithout directly paying for it. If there are too many free riders, the market could fail because the\nresources could become economically infeasible to produce without enough consumers paying to\nutilize it.\nIn general, recognizing these market failures can be extremely beneficial in understanding how\nto correct inefficiencies and ensure the overall wellbeing of our society. Hopefully, this\nexplanation has helped better clarify the course content.\nBest,\nPriya Kalra\nWord Count: 499 words\nFriedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A. over New Limits on Deadly Pollution.” The\nNew Y ork Times, 6 Mar. 2024.\n(Link to article:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=1 )",

      "essay": "To: MyFriendandClassmateinEcon@umich.edu\nSubject: Learning Market Failure\nI hear you need help learning about market failure, to start I would first simply tell you\nthat market failure is something that causes a market to not operate at the efficient level. Below I\nhave attached an article showing the idea of a negative externality which is an example of a\nspecific market failure. The definition of a negative externality is an uncompensated cost\nimposed by a company on another individual or company. To put it simply, a negative externality\nis an unexpected cost added to either the same or a different company from one company's\nactions. The article I chose in this case details the pollution created by the concrete/cement\nindustry through the release of CO2 gas during the refinement of limestone.\nOne thing to understand is that while market failure may not necessarily affect the\ncompany/individual causing the failure there is a chance it can but there is also the chance it may\naffect everyone or just simply a different company/individual. In this article we see a very basic\nexample of a negative externality in the form of pollution from the cement/concrete industry,\nwhich in this case affects the workers and every other person in the world but does not affect the\ncompany itself. The reason this becomes a market failure is because though these effects exist\nthey will not be reflected in the cost of the cement leading to inefficiency. Another factor that\nleads to this causing inefficiency is the fact that pollution is waste and therefore the yield of the\nfinal material will be less than the required material to make the cement making percent yield\nless than optimal. A third reason this is inefficient is due to the fact that it affects everyone but\nnot everyone is a customer of the cement industry.\nThe main points to take away from this are that a market failure is something that leads\nthe market to operate inefficiently. A negative externality is a type of market failure caused by a\ncompany/individual on another company/individual and/or themselves. THe final takeaway I\nwould urge you to consider is that fact that negative externalities are not the only type of market\nfailures and that there are many more possible failures.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\tAs you know, efficiency occurs when a market is able to maximize it’s total surplus. Market failure occurs when the market equilibrium is not efficient and therefore unable to maximize total surplus. There are multiple reasons that a market can fail, in Econ-101 the causes that we have gone over are externalities, artificially scarce goods, common resources and natural resources. All of these can cause the market equilibrium to be inefficient. \n\tA negative externality is when there is an impact on a population or people who are not directly consuming a product. When a negative externality is present, it means that the true cost of a unit or item is higher than the market price. This difference between the actual cost and the market price is what we call the Social Marginal Cost. On the opposite side, when a positive externality is present, there is a benefit to a population or people who are not directly consumers of a product. As you can guess, this means the true value of a unit or item is greater than the market price. The difference between the actual value and market price is called the Social Marginal Benefit. In both cases, the market price, while in equilibrium with our supply and demand curves, is not actually efficient. When the market is not efficient, we end up with dead weight loss, which can be described as the surplus that neither consumer nor producer gains but could become surplus if the market was efficient. When a negative externality is present, the efficient quantity is often actually less than market equilibrium, while a positive externality indicates that the efficient quantity is greater than market equilibrium.\n\tNow that we have a firm understanding of externalities and the roles that they play in market failure, I would like to apply this to the cigarette industry and an article I found in the Wall Street Journal that demonstrates market failure.  Traditionally, cigarette sales represent a negative externality, as secondhand smoke has negative health ramifications on people who do not smoke themselves. This alone represents a market failure as there is social marginal cost attached to the sale of every pack of cigarettes. In this article, it describes how traditional cigarettes are losing their share within the nicotine market as consumers can purchase substitutes in consumption such as vapes and pouches which offer the benefits of nicotine with reduced health risks. Additionally, the sale of nicotine pouches and vaporizers, have reduced the risk of secondhand smoke to people who do not consume nicotine, effectively making the market for vapes and pouches efficient. However, cigarette sales have been in a decline between 2018 and 2023, but cigarette companies were still able to maintain a profit during this period. How did they do that? By increasing the prices of cigarettes, even though there was decrease in demand. This is an example of artificially scarce goods. While the quantity of cigarettes sold was decreasing, the amount consumers were paying was increasing, which creates an inefficiency in the market and is considered market failure. This is because it fails to maximize total surplus, which includes the consumer and producer surplus. \n\tI hope this email gave you an increased understanding of market failure and its causes.

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI hope everything is getting better with your family! Regarding market failures, I can\ndefinitely help! In general, a market failure is when a specific market does not reach its efficient\noutcome; that is, without intervention from an outside party–like the government. It’s important\nto remember that a market can be in equilibrium without it being at its efficient outcome. We can\ntell if a market is at its efficient point by seeing if total surplus is at its maximum, meaning\nconsumer surplus and producer surplus are at their highest points and deadweight loss is at its\nlowest. Markets fail if maximized total surplus, or a maximized societal net gain, is not achieved.\nThere are many types of market failures but as you asked, I found a market failure in the\nNew Y ork Times about Canada’s logging industry to highlight just one type:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html . (Austen,\nVjosa) The type of externality I found is a negative externality. An externality, positive or\nnegative, is a direct effect on a third party unrelated to the market in question by the actions of\nthe participants of a market that are unintentional and are uncompensated. In Canada’s logging\nindustry, for example, deforestation of Canada’s largest forest–The Boreal Forests–is directly\naffecting the surrounding ecosystem. The elimination of the trees means that there are less\nhabitats available for its ecosystem, there is more carbon released to the air affecting the entire\nglobe’s climate, and is currently only leaving younger trees whose bark is less protective against\nwildfires than their older counterparts. (Austen, Vjosa) These effects are unintentional; they are\ncutting down trees to make profit, not with the goal of affecting the environment. They are also\nuncompensated meaning the logging industry is not forced to to fix these effects.\nAs mentioned earlier, this is a negative externality. A negative externality is an\nexternality that puts a cost on a third party, while a positive externality gives a benefit to a third\nparty without requiring compensation from the third party back to the market participant. This is\na negative externality because what’s happening to the third party–the environment and\necosystem–is a cost and a burden to them.\nWe can look at this idea of a negative externality from the perspective of total net\nbenefits, or society’s net gain. Society’s net gain and total surplus looks at everyone affected by\nthe market, not just the producers and consumers of the logs. While the producers and consumers\ngain from the logging market, there is a loss of welfare to the environment that is not considered\nwhen the market is in action. Since this loss of welfare is unaccounted for, the point at which the\nmarket settles without intervention is not optimal and does not maximize total net benefits; this\nmeans the logging market has failed due to the negative externality.\nHopefully this connects all the ideas surrounding negative externality market failures for\nyou.

I remember you mentioning your struggle to understand the concept of market failure in our last Econ 101 class. I've found an excellent example that ties into what we’ve been learning to help you understand it better, using a recent article from The New York Times about a measles outbreak linked to vaccine hesitancy.\nIn general, market failure occurs when the free market is unable to distribute resources effectively, resulting in a loss of economic value. Even though this idea may be abstract, examples from everyday life can make its implications clear. Market failures can take many different forms, including positive externalities, negative externalities, artificial scarcity of goods, public goods, and common resources. Each type demonstrates a distinct way in which the market may fall short of producing the best result.\nThe article I came across talks about a measles outbreak, which is an example of how markets can fail when there are negative impacts and insufficient supply of a public good, in this case vaccination. When someone takes an action that has an impact on a third party without fully enduring the costs or benefits of that action, this is known as an externality. When it comes to measles, people who choose not to get vaccinated not only put themselves at risk but also raise the risk to others in their community, particularly those who are unable to receive the vaccination due to medical conditions.\nVaccination is considered a public good because it's non-excludable and non-rivalrous – no one can be effectively excluded from its benefits, and one person's vaccination doesn't affect the availability for someone else. On the other hand, not getting vaccinated reduces herd immunity and jeopardizes public health. Due to people's failure to fully consider the social consequences of their decisions, a crucial public good has been underprovided, which is a classic example of market failure.\nIn regard to our Econ 101 lessons, the scenario described in the article emphasizes how critical it is to comprehend the wider effects of individual choices made in a market economy. Markets are effective tools for distributing resources, but they sometimes fail to take into consideration the social costs and benefits of individual actions. As a result, government intervention is necessary to address those flaws. According to The New York Times, this measles outbreak highlights the need for laws that promote vaccination and safeguard the public's health by demonstrating how individual decisions based on misinformation or mistrust can result in serious public health issues (Tufekci). Here is a link where you can read more about this situation and its implications: The New York Times Article.\nUnderstanding these ideas not only benefits us academically but also encourages us to make better decisions as members of our society.

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI hope you're managing okay with everything going on back home. I understand keeping\nup with Econ 101 can be a bit challenging, especially with concepts like market failure that\nwe've just started to learn. I came across an article that might help clarify things through a\nreal-world example, and I thought of you.\nMarket failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not\nefficient, often leading to negative outcomes for society that are not reflected in market prices.\nThere are several types of market failures including externalities, common resources, public\ngoods, and artificially scarce goods.The article, \"As Use of A.I. Soars, so Does the Energy and\nWater It Requires,\" by David Berreby on Y ale E360, dives into the environmental impact of\nartificial intelligence (AI) and illustrates a case of market failure through negative externalities\nand the overexploitation of common resources. Here is the link:\nhttps://e360.yale.edu/features/artificial-intelligence-climate-energy-emissions.\nExternalities are either positive or negative. Positive externalities result in societal\nbenefits not considered in market transactions, leading to less production than is socially ideal.\nThis happens because consumers don't account for the extra societal benefits, causing the\ndemand curve to fall behind the social marginal benefit curve. Conversely, negative externalities\noccur when societal costs are ignored by producers, resulting in overproduction. This is because\nproducers overlook the external costs, pushing the supply curve beyond the social marginal cost\ncurve, and in turn, the market exceeds the socially efficient output.\nBerreby explains that the rapid expansion of AI technology has led to a significant\nincrease in energy and water consumption. An example mentioned was, “Google’s data centers\nconsumed about 5 billion gallons (nearly 20 billion liters) of fresh water for cooling” (Berreby\n2024). These resources are used not just for powering the AI, but also for cooling down the\nmassive data centers that keep AI operations running. This spike in consumption has led to\nincreased carbon emissions and water usage, costs that are not accounted for in the price of AI\ntechnologies. As a result, these unintentional costs encourage overuse and contribute to\nenvironmental degradation, making it a negative externality.\nMoreover, the competition for common resources like water and energy increases, further\ndemonstrating market failure. These resources are being diverted to sustain data centers, often\nwithout proper compensation or consideration of the broader impact. In the case of AI, the\nenvironmental consequences of its rapid expansion presents a clear example of how external\ncosts and the overuse of common resources can lead to inefficiencies.\nThese ideas are important for economists and policymakers because they help them\ncreate plans like taxes and regulations to deal with these problems.

      "essay": "Re: Help Understanding Market Failure\nTo: Friend\nFrom: Econ 101 Student\nHello Friend,\nI heard that you were having trouble understanding the concept of market failure that we’ve\nbeen discussing in class. Well for starters, market failure is when the market fails to reach\nefficiency, regardless if a market reaches equilibrium or not. This means even if a market can\nreach a price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, it still isn’t where the market\nreaches efficiency. What is reaching efficiency? Well it is determined if the market maximizes its\ntotal surplus. So in other words, market failure occurs when the market on its own (without the\nintervention of the government or any outside sources) produces deadweight loss which is a\nloss of surplus on the consumer or producer side. This causes the market to fail to maximize\ntotal surplus. Market failures can be caused by externalities, market power, or non-private goods\n(Dudley, 2024).\nNow, let’s look at a real-world example of a market failure that is caused by a negative\nexternality published by The Wall Street Journal. The article is titled,\n“Cold Weather Businesses\nSuffer in the Winter that Wasn’t”\n. The article is about how this winter was one of the warmest\nwinters yet, as ski resorts, ice sculpture businesses, etc. has seen a 60% decline in revenue\ncompared to last winter. That is a loss of $4.2 billion due to the planet warming up, triggering the\nEl Niño weather effect. El Niño is a condition in which part of the earth rapidly heats up and\ncreates drier/milder conditions in North America (Niiler, 2023). This is partially due to pollution\ncreated by producers and consumers of other markets, as the increasing fossil fuels burned by\ndriving cars or industrial plants warms up the atmosphere and traps the heat inside of our\nplanet, causing cold winters to become warmer (Denchak, 2022). This causes a decrease in\ndemand for skiing and other winter goods and services, which is a prime example of a negative\nexternality.\nWhere does the winter entertainment market fail you may ask? Well, if the market couldn’t reach\nthe equilibrium price in the first place with the effects of pollution (where quantity supplied\nequals quantity demanded), then it certainly couldn’t reach efficiency either. This means in order\nto offset the negative externality (pollution), there must be a solution that makes people take into\naccount the cost they are imposing on others. This can be done through a tax that equals the\nsame amount as the external cost, as people are more likely to reconsider the effects of\npollution they’re imposing on others if it's in the form of a tax that they have to pay. Additionally,\nit can also be done by issuing a limited amount of tradable permits for pollution emitting\nactivities, as the amount of tradable permits has to equal the socially optimal quantity.\nI hope this example of market failure in the winter entertainment industry has helped with your\nunderstanding of the concept. If you have any additional questions, please don’t hesitate to\nreach out.\nSincerely,\nEcon 101 Student\nWords: 500\nSources\nCarlton, Jim.\n“Cold Weather Businesses Suffer in the Winter That Wasn’t.\n” WSJ, 8 Mar. 2024,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/cold-weather-businesses-suffer-in-the\n-winter-that-wasnt-a59ac42b.\nNiiler, Eric.\nDenchak, Melissa.

      "essay": "There is market failure present in almost all markets. There are multiple factors that cause market failure, these include: common resources, positive externalities, negative externalities, artificially scarce goods, and public goods. These things happen when there is an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the market. An example of this can be found in the article “Microplastics are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns”. The market failure represented in this article is a negative externality. \n\tA negative externality occurs when the production of a good results in third party cost. According to this article, “The U.N 400 million metric tons (of plastic) churned out annually … will remain on the earth in some form” (Jacobs). This is a problem for many because much of this plastic is found in the world’s water supply. This affects third parties in multiple ways. Based on the article, these “microplastics” are found in the seafood we eat and can be found in our lungs and blood (Jacobs). This has a negative effect on many people. This causes problems within the food industry. People are going to become less likely to eat seafood with the resulting health effects that it causes. It also clearly causes negative effects on human health because it is not healthy to have micro plastics in our bodies. All of these negative effects represent a negative externality. Due to the fact that these microplastics are not directly related to the people and industries they affect they are considered the third party. Many people and industries are contributing to these massive amounts of plastics in the ocean and people and the food industry are paying the price. This is an issue because the big corporations who produce massive amounts of plastics do not consider the price that it has on people and their health. \nOf course there are many benefits with the production of plastic for these companies. There are also many benefits to us with the mass production of plastics. For example, they help provide cheaper prices and help create single use medical products (Jacobs). However, when we consider these benefits with the external cost that it causes others their “benefit” diminishes. Due to this, a new curve is created called the social marginal cost curve representing the affected society and total cost of the producer. The new efficient quantity is where this curve and the demand curve intersect. This will cause deadweight loss within the market as it is an efficient market. \n\nWord Count: 415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=2. \n\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear friend, \nI hope you are doing well. In the classes that you have missed unexpectedly since you're traveling home, we have been discussing the concept of market failure, an important aspect in economics. Market failure is defined as the economic situation where there is an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. \nCurrently, there is a real life example that vividly showcases a form of market failure. This particular instance has deepened my understanding of market failure, and I am certain it will provide you with valuable insight as well. It is a contemporary illustration of market failure unfolding in today’s economy, and interestingly, it is occurring not far from my home. \nIn the Washington Post, an article came out on March 15, 2024 about how in Washington D.C, restaurant industries have been negatively impacted by the rise of violent crime. Specifically a 59% increase of crime, on restaurants, cars, and other retailers has happened throughout the city. This has contributed to the empty restaurants and empty offices. With the heightened fear that citizens feel due to this rise of criminal activity, it has prompted people to stay home rather than dine out, adversely impacting the revenue of restaurants in these areas. \nThis type of market failure is negative externality. A negative externality refers to the uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others, also, known as an external cost. Restaurants are experiencing negative externalities because the crimes occurring are not within their control, yet they bear the adverse effects of these external factors. \nSince the recent rise in crime in D.C, restaurants are forced to pay for added security out of their pockets, taking away from their profits. Additionally, there has been a decline in activity in the restaurant due to the fact that people are scared to hang around these crime filled areas with family. Many restaurants are being compelled to shut down. \nThese circumstances represent market failure because of the inefficiency in the distribution of goods and services, caused by external factors such as crime, undermining the functions of the free market system. Despite not being responsible for the crimes, restaurants are taking the fall, leading to closures and economic losses.  \nI hope this example of market failure from the Washington Post has helped you grasp an understanding of what we have been discussing in class for the past few days.

      "essay": "Hey friend,\nI heard you needed some help understanding market failure in Econ 101. Market failure\nis when a free market experiences intrinsic inefficiencies related to that market. If a\ngovernment or outside force causes this inefficiency, this is not market failure. The most\ncommon and obvious form of market failure is an externality. Externalities are when a\nmarket affects a person that is not the consumer or producer positively or negatively. An\nexample of a positive externality is with a vaccine. When I get a vaccine, it protects the\npeople around me because they are less likely to get the disease from me. A common\nexample of a negative externality is pollution. Specifically, deforestation has many\nnegative externalities. Wood and paper are necessary in today’s way of life. This means\nthere is an almost infinite demand for lumber worldwide. The producers who cut down\nthe trees make money and the consumers receive a very useful good. While this seems\nlike a win-win situation, deforestation in many parts of the world has had drastic effects\non the environment. The Amazon rainforest in South America is one of the largest carbon\nabsorbers in the world and now, the areas that have been heavily deforested are now\ncarbon sources due to the lack of trees. Over 20% of the Amazon has been deforested.\nThis has a noticeable effect on climate change, wildlife, and air quality.\nBrazil contains nearly 60% of the Amazon rainforest and is currently trying to influence\nthe lumber industry and save the rainforest. This free market has failed to be efficient on\nits own, so now government intervention needs to happen to try and bring the market\nback to equilibrium. Their goal is to end forest destruction by 2030 in hopes of restoring\nthe natural beauty and usefulness of the rainforest. Since the current president of Brazil\nentered office, deforestation has dropped 34% since the same time last year. They have\ntaken donations from other countries to fund their environmental agencies and to monitor\nillegal deforestation using drones or helicopters. This is a very crucial effort to fight\nclimate change and the more help they get, the better they can protect the rainforest.\nWhile most markets tend to be most efficient on their own, sometimes it takes\nintervention to guide the market in the right direction and keep it beneficial for all parties.\nThis is just one example of a market failure that I hope helps you wrap your head around\nthe idea a little better.\nHope this helped,\nStephen Cibulas\nPearson, Samantha, and Luciana Magalhaes. “Latin American Countries Aim to Curb\nAmazon Deforestation - WSJ.” Wall Street Journal,\nwww.wsj.com/articles/latin-american-countries-aim-to-curb-amazon-deforestation-c479cfd\n5.

      "essay": "To: Gabe\nFrom: Econ 101 Student\nSubject: Market Failure & Externalities, Explanation and Example\nHey Gabe, sorry you missed class, I’ll help you out and explain what we learned about\nmarket failure. At a high level, market failure is defined as when the market on its own (without\ngovernment or outside intervention) fails to be efficient. Remember also that a market is efficient\nwhen total surplus is maximized. Up to this point, the only examples of inefficient markets that\nwe have seen are from government intervention. However, externalities are another concept that\ncan make a market fall out of efficiency.\nAn externality is something that has impacts outside of its own market, or rather a third\nparty, not simply the buyer or the seller, is affected by the happenings of the market. There are\ntwo separate kinds of externalities, positive and negative. A positive externality is a benefit that\nan individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation. A negative externality is\nan uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others.\nWhen a negative externality is measured and placed overtop a supply and demand graph,\nit is called the social marginal cost. A new line is added to the graph, above and parallel to\nsupply. In between the supply and SMC is the total external cost, the area of total surplus it\ncovers is subtracted from the original total surplus. Similarly, positive externalities also add a\nnew line to the graph, called external marginal benefit. It lays parallel and above the demand\ncurve. The area that this takes up is added to the total surplus. Deadweight loss lays in between\nthe quantity of the market and quantity of efficiency.\nI found an article online that might help you conceptualize the idea of how an externality\nis a market failure: Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance. Is Health Insurance Next? In this\ninstance, the large controllable for your own health insurance prices would be individual health\nchoices, like choosing not to smoke. But because of the negative externality that climate change\nand wildfires are, you no longer have the choice to not breath smoke. Then your insurance rises\nto componsate for hospitalizations caused by something you, nor the insurer could control.\nIn class, we had a few examples for each. A common positive externality would be\nvaccines. Even if you aren't vaccinated, and most people around you are, you still get most of the\nbenefit of being vaccinated because less of the disease is being passed around without paying for\na vaccine. On the contrary, a negative externality is something like pollution. Let's say that a\nleather factory dumps its waste into a river that people use for agriculture and drinking water,\nthat water is now polluted and causing harm to those who utilize it. They neither produced nor\npurchased any leather, but are being hurt by the leather market.\nWord Count: 468\nWorks Cited: Khan, Y usuf. “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI would love to help you understand the concept of a market failure. The definition of a market\nfailure is anything that causes a market for a good or a service to lose efficiency. In economic\nterms, efficiency is when total surplus is maximized, or when both consumers and producers are\nreceiving their respective “best” outcomes. I’ll give you an example of a specific market failure.\nThe article I have attached in this email pertains to the concept of a positive externality. This\narticle describes a curious effect that has been occurring throughout major American cities. It\nappears that an increase in street art has been associated with an increase in public safety. It is\nmentioned in the article that this may be because drivers are more aware and cognizant of their\nsurroundings when their surroundings stand out. Specifically, pedestrian crashes were reduced by\n50% and drivers began to yield to pedestrians 27% more in cities such as New Y ork, Seattle, and\nPortland. It may not seem intuitive that something with a good effect on society would be\ndeemed a market failure. However, because this occurrence does not account for the benefit this\nart provides to third parties in the form of increased pedestrian safety, reduction in property\ndamage, and/or reduction in traffic congestion, it is considered a failure of the market. An\nexternality is defined as a market that confers an effect (this can be a benefit or a consequence)\non an unrelated third party. Negative externalities impose consequences, while positive\nexternalities impose benefits. Intuitively, as a positive externality, if street art provides value\noutside of the street art market (meaning it provides value to more than just consumers and\nproducers in the street art market), then there should be more street art in the world – the optimal\nquantity of street art is less realistically than it should be. The optimal price of street art also\nincreases, as logically it is “worth” more than it is in the market itself. This optimal quantity is\nwhat we find when we consider the added benefit street art brings to society. The optimal price\nand quantity are found where the social marginal benefit (found by adding the social benefit to\nthe marginal benefit, or demand, of consumers in the street art market) intersects the social\nmarginal cost (supply of the producers in the street art market).

      "essay": "Market Failure\nHi,\nI heard that you traveled home due to a family emergency, I am so sorry to hear that.\nSince you missed class, I will get you up to speed on the new topic we learned which is market\nfailure. This whole idea of market failure relies on your fundamental knowledge on when a\nmarket is efficient. As you recall from our past unit, a market is efficient by maximizing its total\nsurplus which, in other words, is maximizing society’s total net gain. This allows the optimal\nallocation of goods/resources so there is no waste. Market failure is just the inefficient allocation\nof these goods/resources which results in waste. Market failure can be caused by externalities,\ncommon resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nBefore we look at the specifics of the space exploration market, I want to teach you about\nexternalities. Externalities come in two forms, positive and negative. A positive externality is\ncaused due to unforeseen/unaccounted for benefits that create inefficiencies in the market. At a\nmore technical level, the Societal Marginal Benefit curve (SMB) is greater than the free market\ndemand. This leads to an underproduction of the correct number of goods society wants. On the\nother hand, a negative externality is caused due to unforeseen/unaccounted for costs that create\ninefficiencies in the market. In this case, the Societal Marginal Cost curve (SMC) is greater than\nthe free market supply which would lead to an overproduction of goods.\nWith the space exploration market, there is a ton of pollution that gets generated as we\npush our limits. As Hall states, “In the past few years, the number of rocket launches has spiked\nas commercial companies…and government agencies have lofted thousands of satellites into\nlow-Earth orbit.” This market has consistently grown over the past few decades, but it has not\ncome without a cost. As more rockets are being launched, they continuously pollute our\natmosphere which results in a variety of concerns like its effects on the environment and human\nhealth. In fact, a study found that the soot from rockets is “nearly 500 times as efficient at\nheating the atmosphere as soot released from sources like airplanes closer to the surface” (Hall).\nAs you can see, this market is exhibiting the traits of a negative externality. To be more\nspecific, the pollution that is generated from space exploration will be the specific reason why\nthis market is held back. It is clear that many producers in the market are not really concerned\nwith or accounting for the effects of pollution. If we would draw this market, we would see the\nSMC curve is greater than the free market supply. This would result in a market that is\noverproducing which creates inefficiency (i.e. Deadweight Loss). However, with government\nintervention, this market can become efficient again. A tax on the producers will result in the free\nmarket supply to be shifted towards the SMC curve creating a societal efficient market.\nBest,\nJawad\nWord Count: 498\nWorks Cited\nHall, Shannon. “The New Space Race Is Causing New Pollution Problems.” The New York\nTimes, The New Y ork Times, 9 Jan. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/science/rocket-pollution-spacex-satellites.html.",

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\nI am so sorry to hear about your family emergency. I hope you and your family are doing\nokay. I am happy to keep you up to date and help you understand the concept of market failure.\nIn simple terms, market failure is when the market fails to be efficient on its own. A market\nfailure occurs when there is an inefficient distribution of goods and services. This means the\nquantity of goods/services supplied isn’t equal to the quantity of goods/services demanded.\nWhen a market fails to function efficiently on its own, absent government intervention, it means\nsomething is stopping it from maximizing its total surplus.\nThere are four major market failures: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods,\nand Artificially Scarce Goods. To further help you visualize these concepts, I am going to focus\non externalities, specifically negative externalities. There are positive and negative externalities.\nThe positive refers to the indirect benefits and the negative refers to the indirect cost that a firm's\ngoods or services confer on third-party consumers. Dr. Dudley explained negative externalities as\n“An uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Also known as an\nExternal Cost.”\nOne of the most common examples of a negative externality is pollution. This is because\nwhen pollution occurs, the producers of that pollution typically don't take on the full cost of their\nactions. For example, a factory might emit pollutants into the air or water as a result of what they\nare producing, but the costs of cleaning up that pollution or dealing with its effects, such as\nhealth problems or environmental damage, are often taken on by society at large, not by the\nfactories. This creates a situation where the true cost of production is not reflected in the prices\nof goods or services, leading to overconsumption and overproduction of polluting goods.\nA real life example of pollution as a negative externality is in the article in the New Y ork\nTimes called “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A Over New Limits on Deadly Pollution” by Lisa\nFriedman. This article talks about how the Environmental Protection Agency made the decision\nto lower the limits “for fine particulate matter to nine micrograms per cubic meter of air…” This\nmakes it easier for the small particles to penetrate the lungs and bloodstream faster and easier\nwhich can increase asthma, cause an increase in premature deaths, and increase risk of heart\ndisease. This shows a negative externality because this change indirectly causes negative effects\non multiple parties such as an increase in costs for manufacturers, utilities, and health and safety\neffects on the public. This decision also caused a loss of jobs in the United States as well as\noverseas, leaving hardworking families to suffer.\nI hope I was able to help you understand the concept of market failure. If you have any\nother questions please let me know. I hope you and your family are doing well. See you soon!\nBest,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 499\nReferences\nFriedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A. over New Limits on Deadly Pollution.” The\nNew Y ork Times, The New Y ork Times, 6 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=1.",

      "essay": "Hi XXX,\nI hope this email finds you well! I know recently you have stumbled upon the concept of market\nfailure in ECON 101 and I am more than glad to help with a news article for illustration. The\narticle is titled \"Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance. Is Health Insurance Next?\" and is\npublished in The Wall Street Journal. It sheds light on the profound economic consequences on\ninsurance businesses due to extreme heat and wildfires caused by climate change.\nIn class, we've talked about what market failure is and it happens when the market fails to reach\nan efficient outcome even though it’s in equilibrium. One thing to point out is that the market has\nto fail by itself. In this case, government intervention is not classified as market failure. Besides,\nexternalities causing market failure are entities that are unaffiliated with the market originally\nand don’t change the market supply and demand. The article I came across highlights the\nnegative externalities associated with climate change, particularly the social costs imposed on\nhome and health insurance companies and society as a whole.\nHere's how it breaks down: Extreme heat and wildfires, intensified by climate change, lead to an\nincrease in hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory illnesses. Individuals exposed to these\nconditions face higher health risks, resulting in increased healthcare costs. While individuals may\nbear some of these costs, a significant portion is covered by health insurance companies, which\nthen impacts premiums and coverage for all policyholders. In this case, the supply and demand\nof insurance are unchanged, but insurance companies are facing a higher social cost due to\nclimate change uncertainty.\nThe inability of insurers to accurately predict and plan for these increased costs due to climate\nchange-induced health impacts results in inefficiencies in the insurance market. In this case, the\ntrue social costs of climate change-related health impacts are not fully internalized in insurance\npricing, leading to the misallocation of resources and welfare losses for society. Moreover, the\nlack of historical and detailed data on how climate change affects health outcomes further\ncomplicates the situation. This data deficiency makes it challenging for health insurers to build\naccurate predictive models, which are crucial for setting premiums and allocating resources\nefficiently. Such a loss of economic efficiency is called deadweight loss.\nOverall, the article highlights how externalities associated with climate change disrupt the\ninsurance market, leading to inefficiencies and welfare losses for society. By understanding these\nexternalities and their effects on market outcomes, I hope this analysis provides a deeper insight\ninto the concept of market failure and its relevance in the context of climate change and health\ninsurance.

      "essay": "Hi Friend,\nI heard you’re struggling with the concept of market failure in our Econ class. I’m happy to help!\nFor basics, a market failure occurs when a market, without government intervention, fails to\nreach its efficient outcome. Remember, an efficient market maximizes total societal surplus. So\nto put it in other words, a market failure occurs when the market fails to maximize societal\nsurplus. It is important to note that equilibrium does not mean efficiency, so a market failure can\noccur while said market is in equilibrium.\nThere are four types of market failure, but for now I will focus on one: Externalities. An\nexternality is a benefit/cost that an individual or firm imposes on an unrelated third party. There\nare negative and positive externalities; negative externalities are associated with a cost, and\npositive ones with a benefit. For example you receive a positive externality when someone else\ngets vaccinated because it contributes to herd immunity. I have attached an article containing an\nexample of a market failure due to a negative externality. In this scenario, our market of focus is\nagricultural goods in developing countries, specifically for female farmers. Farmers in these\ncountries are losing profit due to increased global temperatures from the burning of fossil fuels\nby industrialized countries. Female farmers already have difficulty competing with male farmers,\nwho generally have better access to technology, and now the increasing temperatures make these\ndisparities even greater. Women in these countries lose nearly a third more of their income than\nmen do when the global temperature rises by one degree celsius. From a market perspective, the\nburning of fossil fuels by industrialized countries (the firm) is creating a negative externality on\nthe completely unrelated agricultural market in developing countries (the third party).\nMonetarily, this lost profit from the externality is called an external cost, and this external cost is\nincorporated into the calculation of total societal surplus. With this additional cost, total surplus\nin the market decreases, ultimately preventing the market from being efficient.\nIt is possible for a market failure to reach its efficient outcome by eliminating the externality,\nhowever it requires some effort. In order for an externality to be eliminated, every member in\nboth involved markets must come together to discuss and find a solution that both sides are\nsatisfied with. For a small scale externality, this may be a reasonable possibility. However, for\nlarge scale situations, a fair solution can be very hard to find; in my example it would require\nindustrialized countries to find an environmentally clean fuel alternative that is at most the same\ncost as the fossil fuels they currently use. Additionally, transaction costs to find this solution can\nbecome astronomically high. Transaction costs are the costs of bringing these people from both\nmarkets together in order to discuss. Examples are transportation or housing for these people. As\nyou can imagine, the transaction costs of bringing whole countries together to discuss is far too\nhigh to ever be considered a feasible solution, so unfortunately many negative externality market\nfailures, including the one attached, will never reach their efficient outcome.\nWord Count: 498\nSources:\nSengupta, Somini. “Global Warming Is Particularly Bad for Women-Led Families, Study Says.”\nThe New Y ork Times, The New Y ork Times, 5 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/05/climate/women-families-poverty-global-warming.html.",

      "essay": "Dear Econ 101 Friend,\nI heard you needed help understanding the concept of market failures. The overall idea of\na market failure is that a market for a good or service is not operating at an efficient level. This\nmeans that there is some factor that isn’t being accounted for at the current market equilibrium\nthat would shift the price in some way, whether that be up or down. This factor is usually the\nresult of the consumer getting some sort of added/lessened marginal benefit from the good or\nservice that isn’t taken into consideration when forming the current equilibrium price. This\nresults in the market failing to produce an optimal outcome and creates deadweight loss hence\nthe name market failure.\nOne prime example of this can be found in the New Y ork Times article, “Microplastics\nAre a Big Problem, a New Film Warns”. This article talks about a new film highlighting the\ndangers of microplastics to human health as highlighted by the quote, “It doesn’t matter if you’re\nrich or poor, there’s no sheltering yourself from this kind of new pollution.” (New Y ork Times).\nThis article represents a term related to market failure called a negative externality. A negative\nexternality is a negative effect a good or service has that imposes additional costs on society that\nare not reflected in the market price. In this case, the negative health impacts illustrate the\nadverse costs imposed by plastic products. This means that the market for plastic products is not\noperating at an optimal level. To get to an efficient price, the supply curve would shift right to\naccount for the added price of the health effects on society. Some examples of market failures\nother than negative externalities include positive externalities, public goods, and common goods.\nA positive externality is effectively the opposite of a negative externality where a product has a\npositive effect on society that isn’t reflected in the price. Public goods can result in market failure\ndue to the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem occurs when a good is non-excludable and\nsome consumers opt not to pay because they can benefit from the good without doing so which\nshifts the efficient price but not the equilibrium price. Common goods can cause market failure\nthrough a phenomenon called the tragedy of the commons. This occurs when there is a limited\namount of a non-excludable good. Consumers will act only based on their own benefit and\ndeplete the good once again shifting the efficient price but not the equilibrium price.\nOverall, a market failure occurs when the equilibrium price of a market does not coincide\nwith the efficient price. This can be caused by externalities, public goods, and common goods as\nshown by the real-life example in the New Y ork Times.

      "essay": "Dear John,\nOf course, I would be more than happy to explain market failure to you. A market is\nexperiencing market failure when, at equilibrium, it fails to maximize society's total surplus\n(Dudley). One way a market can fail is externalities, which can be either positive or negative. An\nexternality occurs when a third party not directly involved with a transaction either benefits\n(positive) or is harmed (negative) by consequences of the transaction (Dudley). Positive\nexternalities are unaccounted for societal benefits, resulting in an equilibrium quantity and price\nthat are too low to maximize total surplus. Negative externalities are unaccounted for social\ncosts, resulting in an equilibrium quantity that is too high and a price that is too low, creating\ndeadweight loss (Dudley).\nIn an ideal market, the consumer marginal benefit is equal to the social marginal benefit, the\nproducer marginal cost is equal to the social marginal cost, and a graph of total surplus is the\nsupply and demand curve. Positive externalities shift the social marginal benefit rightward, while\nnegative externalities shift the social marginal cost leftward. Importantly, supply and demand are\nnot changed (Dudley).\nAnother cause of market failure are goods incompatible with our idealized market model. Ideally\na good is excludable, its access can be restricted (outside of government control) and is a rival in\nconsumption, meaning multiple people cannot use the same good at the same time. When a good\nis non-exclusive, free riders who do not contribute to the upkeep/production of a good cause\nmarket failure through unaccounted for benefit (Dudley). When a good is non-competitive, the\nmarginal cost of allowing access to the good is zero, so the efficient price becomes zero dollars.\nThe market fails because the marginal cost of producing another unit of the good is not zero, so\nproducers must charge a non-zero price to stay in business (Dudley). Competitive, non-\nexcludible goods are common resources, whose unlimited access but limited supply causes over\nconsumption which leads to negative externalities and free riders whose marginal benefit is not\naccounted for. Non-excludable, non-rival in consumption public goods cannot restrict access to\nfree riders and have an efficient price of zero, resulting in an undervalued marginal benefit and\nan inability to sustain production at an efficient price (Dudley).\nFinally, excludable, non-rival in consumption goods are artificially scarce goods. In an example\nof this type of good, “Spotify Earnings: Losses Narrow amid Subscriber Growth, Price Increase.”\nAnne Steele discusses how Spotify has struggled to remain profitable but has been succeeding\nsince their decision to raise prices. Because it costs Spotify nothing to allow one more person to\nlisten to their music, the efficient price for Spotify is zero dollars, and the price change decreased\nconsumer surplus, increasing deadweight loss and lowering total surplus. However, the marginal\ncost of creating one more unit, Spotify’s cost of licensing and producing music, podcasts, and\naudiobooks, is not zero. Thus, the only way services like Spotify can exist and create new\nproducts while maximizing total surplus at market equilibrium would be a government subsidy\nthat completely covers the cost to the consumer.\nI hope that helps, feel free to reach out with any further questions,\nYour Classmate\nWord Count (Excluding heading, greeting, closing, and citations as specified on piazza): 490\nwords\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities.” ECON 101: Principles of Economics I, Accessed\n3/25/2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nDudley, Mitchell. “Public Goods and Common Resources.” ECON 101: Principles of Economics\nI, Accessed 3/25/2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nSteele, Anne. “Spotify Earnings: Losses Narrow amid Subscriber Growth, Price Increase.” The\nWall Street Journal, 6 Feb. 2024, www.wsj.com/business/earnings/spotify-spot-q4-\nearnings-report-2023-d33664d5?st=8jqxdfnve6j3fz1&reflink=article_email_share.\nAccessed 25 Mar. 2024.",

      "essay": "Hi!\n\nHere’s what I know about market failure from class and outside research -- hopefully you find it helpful. \nBasically, a market failure occurs when, without any government intervention, the free market fails to reach an efficient outcome even in equilibrium. This means that even if people inside a market are making the right choices for themselves, they’re likely failing to make the best choices for society as a whole. If you remember our unit on marginal costs and benefits, you can think of it this way: a market has failed when it doesn’t maximize total surplus. \nIt’s a lot easier to make sense of market failures with an example, so let's talk about a specific type of market failure: externalities. An externality occurs when a market creates a completely unrelated cost or benefit for a third party group that doesn’t include producers or consumers. There can be positive externalities or negative externalities. An example of a negative externality is pollution -- I found a great article in the New York Times about mercury pollution that we can use as an example. \nIn the article, the author talks about how the production and consumption of fossil fuels like gasoline expel mercury into the atmosphere. This mercury settles into the ocean where it is eventually consumed by fish. After these fish consume the mercury, it stays in their bodies and can be ingested by humans, causing horrible side effects (Tabuchi). \nMercury pollution is a great example of a negative externality because the fossil fuel market in the United States is completely unrelated to how people consume Bluefin tuna in Japan. Nevertheless, the fossil fuel industry still harms those people without their knowledge. \nIn essence, this means that the fossil fuel industry is incurring something called an external marginal cost (a marginal cost that isn’t accounted for by producers and consumers in the original market). During the production and consumption of fossil fuels, the industry doesn't account for the costs of mercury poisoning, which, when added to the original marginal costs of fossil fuel producers, completely changes how we understand total surplus. \nWithout accounting for external marginal costs, even in equilibrium, the fossil fuel market won’t be efficient. You can imagine external marginal costs like an extra line above the classic supply line on a graph (this is even more helpful when you remember that supply embodies the marginal costs of the producers). The space between the supply line and the external marginal cost line represents total external costs, which will always be a negative number. Basically, when we deal with negative externalities, we subtract the total external cost from total surplus, which means that unless the externality (in our case, Mercury pollution) is corrected, then total surplus will never be maximized, and the market will never be efficient. \nThere are a few other types of market failures, including positive externalities, that I don’t have time to explain in this email, so let me know if you need more help!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord Count: 496\n\nCitations\n\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Why Is Mercury Stubbornly High in Tuna?

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope everything is okay with you and your family. I’m writing to help you understand the concept of market failure that we learned in Econ 101, using a recent news article as an example.\nFirst, let me introduce the general concept of market failure. Market failure occurs when the free market, without intervention, fails to achieve efficiency even in equilibrium. Essentially, it's when the market doesn't maximize the total surplus of society (Dudley, 2024). This can happen due to several reasons, such as externalities, common resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods. I found an article in New York Times that involves the problem of plastic pollution caused by plastic medical devices (Ted, 2024). This is a classic example of market failure in the form of externalities.  \nExternality means a cost or benefit to an unrelated third party that arises as an effect of consumer or producer activities in a market. Generally, externalities are categorized as positive or negative, based on their impacts. Positive externalities refer to benefits experienced by a third party without them compensating the market, while negative externalities refer to costs imposed on a third party without the market compensating them (Dudley, 2024). In the news article, negative externality arises from the market of medical devices such as inhalers and insulin pens. For instance, when consumers purchase and use plastic inhalers, the resulting plastic waste can contribute to pollution by leaching toxins into oceans and land. Additionally, the production process can generate pollution through the burning of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases. People living near the polluted areas may suffer poor air and water quality, as well as the presence of microplastic in their bodies, even if they are not consumers or producers of plastic inhalers. These external negative effects add to the society’s total marginal cost related to the market and lead to a social marginal cost curve above the market’s supply curve. Meanwhile, the social marginal benefit curve remains identical to the demand curve. In this case, the market equilibrium, where supply and demand curves intersect, fails to capture the maximized total surplus, which occurs at the intersection of the social marginal cost curve and the social marginal benefit curve. Thus, efficiency is not achieved at the market equilibrium.\nTo internalize externalities and mitigate market failure, government intervention is often necessary. The government can directly address the externality (in our example, plastic pollution) or engage with the associated market (market of inhalers). The news article mentions that “Some countries have been drafting a treaty proposal that might ban select single-use products”. This is an example of government intervention through setting production quotas in the associated market. Other intervention methods include establishing environmental standards, imposing Pigouvian taxes on pollution emissions or polluting goods (Dudley, 2024).\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the concept of market failure better. \nWord Count: 467\n \nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities.” ECON 101, University of Michigan, 2024. https://umich.instructure.com/courses/662846/files/33251285/download?wrap=1\nAlcorn, Ted. “Your Inhalers and EpiPens Aren’t Very Healthy for the Environment”.

      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure Econ 101\nHey friend,\nThanks for reaching out! No worries, I totally understand the situation you’re in, I can help fill\nyou in. I think I have a pretty good understanding of Market Failure at this point, let me tell you\nabout it!\nFirst off, market failure occurs when the free market doesn't allocate resources efficiently. In\nsimpler terms, it's when the market doesn't consider all the costs and benefits of a transaction.\nThis often happens because some variables aren't factored into the price of goods or services.\nAs a result, resources aren't allocated optimally, leading to inefficiencies. Some things that are\nmarket failures include positive and negative externalities, common resources, public goods,\nand artificially scarce goods.\nT o help you better understand market failure, I found an example that can help put it simply for\nyou. I came across an article titled \"Pollution Is Making Flowers Less Fragrant, With\nConsequences for Bees\" in The New York Times. In this article, the discussion revolves around\nthe impact of pollution on flowers' fragrance, which has consequences for pollination and bee\npopulations (Anthes). It talks about how pollution impacts flowers' fragrance and, consequently,\naffects pollination and bee populations. Since flowers rely on their fragrance to attract bees and\nother pollinators, changes in flower fragrance can disrupt the natural process of pollination,\naffecting not only the reproductive success of plants but also the health and well-being of bee\npopulations, which play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning (Anthes).\nNow, let's tie this back to market failure. This is a negative externality. Pollution from human\nactivities creates negative externalities, meaning it imposes costs on society that aren't\naccounted for in market transactions. In this case, the pollution alters the fragrance of flowers,\naffecting pollination and bee populations. These effects aren't factored into the price of goods or\nservices involved in polluting activities. Because the market doesn't consider these externalities,\nit fails to allocate resources efficiently. There's a mismatch between the private costs and the\nsocial costs of pollution. As a result, we end up with suboptimal outcomes for society, and the\nmarket fails to achieve efficiency.\nI hope I helped clarify the concept of market failure!

      "essay": "Hello Econ Friend,\nI’m sorry about your family situation, I hope this email helps you better understand market\nfailures! First off, market failures occur when the market for a good or service is not able to\nreach an efficient outcome without intervention. Factors contributing to market failure include\nboth positive or negative externalities.\nExternalities are unaccounted-for benefits or costs that affect third parties without compensation\nin market price. They disrupt market efficiency and prevent the maximization of total surplus.\nPositive externalities provide an uncompensated external benefit, increasing consumer surplus\nwhich creates deadweight loss and leads to an inefficient outcome. Negative externalities do the\nopposite. With a negative externality deadweight loss is also created as consumer and producer\nsurplus decreases due to uncompensated external costs, creating an inefficiency.\nTo help you better understand negative externalities I will walk you through an example of\nmicroplastic pollution. For context, microplastic pollution highlights this market failure since\nproducers of plastic or products using plastic are not responsible for the environmental and\nhealth hazard of microplastics. Production of plastic has reached 400 million metric tons per\nyear, yet its external cost isn't compensated by the producers. Microplastics have been found in\nremote locations and within humans posing serious threats on our health overall (Jacobs).\nPollution's negative impact on society is considered an external cost. Looking into the market for\nplastic, the price of plastic does not reflect its negative implications. For instance, the two\npatients who found microplastics in their brain tumors are not being fiscally compensated for\ntheir illness and healthcare costs as they are considered the third-party (Rodgers). The market for\nplastic fails to represent the true price, as those being harmed are not being factored into the\nprice. This causes the consumer surplus to decrease. In cases of market failures regarding\npollution, the government is able to intervene to try and restore market efficiency. For an\nexternality such as microplastic pollution influenced by a variety of markets for goods and\nservices, the government will opt to impose environmental standards, taxes on plastic\nproduction, and even tradable permits. These methods will push the market towards efficiency,\nreducing the quantity of plastic products produced from all markets and increasing the price for\nboth consumers and producers.\nIt is important to note that depending on the externality, the government might intervene in\ndifferent ways. If there was an externality attached to a specific good or service the government\nmight choose to install specific environmental standards for the producers, taxes on the specific\nproduct, and a production quota.\nHopefully that helped you understand market failures and how they are created through\nexternalities!\nBest,\nEcon 101 Friend\nWord Count (440)\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. \"How Microplastics Are Becoming a Big Health Problem.\" The New Y ork\nTimes, 9 Mar. 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.ht\nml",

      "essay": "Market failure occurs when inefficiencies in the market lead to suboptimal outcomes. An\nexample of this is seen in the article provided, talking about the negative effects of climate\nchange and its effects on insurance companies, particularly in California.\nAccording to Steve Bochanski, the U.S. climate risk modeling leader at\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, insurers are struggling to adapt to climate change. “It’s definitely a\nchallenge how you split out the effects of climate change and other factors [on health].” (Khan)\nAs we can see from this quote, the challenge lies in segregating the impacts of climate change\nfrom other variables, making it difficult to build accurate predictive models. This lack of data\nhampers the insurance companies’ ability to forecast risks accurately. As a result, health\ninsurance companies are pressured to raise their prices to cover the increased risks associated\nwith climate change.\nNot only are health insurance companies affected, but insurance companies in general. Auto and\nhome insurance providers have also adjusted their rates in response to climate-related incidents.\n“Still, climate risk is a priority for all insurers facing mandatory climate reporting in places such\nas the European Union, Singapore and Canada. Companies are now being asked to consider and\nreport how climate change is going to affect their business and how they plan to mitigate it.”\n(Khan). As we can see from this quote, climate change and the risks associated with it are\nwidespread. These measures aim to ensure that companies assess and disclose how climate\nchange could affect their operations and what steps they are taking to mitigate these risks.\nThe situation represents a negative externality, where the actions of two parties (producers and\nconsumers of carbon-emitting products) adversely affect a third party (insurance companies).\nThe resultant higher rates reflect the unaccounted-for costs of carbon emissions. Since insurance\nis excludable (only people who pay for it have access to it) and non-rival (one person purchasing\nit won’t prevent other people from purchasing it), it is an artificially scarce good. Because of this,\nlower income families who can’t afford the rise in insurance rates will be excluded from\npurchasing insurance, leading to a decrease in quantity demanded for insurance products.\nConsequently, the insurance market experiences a drop in profits, underscoring the negative\nexternalities.\nThis example shows a market failure, specifically a negative externality where the exchange of\ntwo parties negatively affects a third party.

Market failure occurs when there is an inefficient allocation of goods and services in the free market. They can be corrected using private market solutions, government intervention, or voluntary collective action. Causes of market failures include: externalities, public goods, and common resources. Such types of goods are categorized by two factors: excludability and rivalry in consumption. Excludability is the ability for a supplier to prevent access through a paywall, and non-excludability being its converse. Rivalry is when the same unit of a given good cannot be used by more than one person at a time and when it can be infinitely consumed, it is called non-excludable. I will focus on public goods and positive externalities in commitment with the attached article. \nThe market failure in this article is the nation’s failure to produce an efficient level of education, leading to the need for publicly funded institutions. The nation distributes education through public schools, which are public goods because they are nonrival in consumption and nonexcludable. Therefore, the market failure can be pinpointed as the nation’s inability to sufficiently supply public goods for medical collegiate education. \nA positive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm confers on a third-party without receiving compensation. This article announces that the Albert Einstein College of Medicine will now be free of tuition for all attendees, due to a one billion dollar donation from Sandy Gotteman, alumni and board chair. This exhibits a positive externality because its social marginal benefit to society is that it absolves the barrier to earning a medical degree and is intended “... to bring healthcare careers within reach for more prospective students…” (WSJ).\nThe Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a common resource that has positive externalities. It is a common resource because it is excludable, as now students do not have to pay to attend, and it is rival in consumption because there are a limited number of enrollment spots for applicants. In this market, the producer is the school administration and the consumers are the students. The efficient equilibrium is determined by where the social marginal cost, or the one billion dollar donation, intersects the social marginal benefit given to society, which is the influx of medically-trained professionals. The market equilibrium fails to internalize the externality and does not generate as much total surplus as possible, therefore failing to be socially efficient. Compared to market equilibrium, when the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was an excludable and rival good – otherwise known as a private good – the efficient equilibrium has increased. Subsequently, producer surplus has increased and consumer surplus decreased compared to the market’s consumer and producer surplus. There is deadweight loss. \nI hope that helps. \n\nSincerely, \nYour Friend\n\n[Word Count: 464]\n\nWorks Cited\nKorn, Melissa. “New Billion-Dollar Gift to Cover Tuition for All at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.” WSJ, February 24, 2024. https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/billion-dollar-gift-to-cover-tuition-for-all-at-nys-albert-einstein-college-of-medicine-7eff2ffc.\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Hello friend,\nMarket failure happens when the market, without government or outside intervention,\nfails to be efficient on its own. It is caused by externalities,common resources, public goods and\nartificially scarce goods. In the case of externalities there are two types: positive and negative,\nwhich contrast in their effect. A positive externality is an uncompensated benefit an individual or\nenterprise receives because of market failure, also known as an external benefit and an example\nof this is vaccinations. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or\nenterprise receives because of market failure. This is also known as an external cost and an\nexample of this pollution.\nRegarding the three kinds of goods, they can be classified as excludable and rival in\nconsumption. When something is excludable, the supplier of the good can keep individuals from\nconsuming it, if they do not pay. When a good is rival in consumption, the same unit of the good\ncannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. An artificially scarce good is non\nrival in consumption and excludable, causing inefficiencies since it is non rival making the\nmarginal cost of providing that good to be zero. A common resource is non-excludable and rival\nin consumption and causes inefficiencies because of the free-rider problem, since consumers do\nnot have to pay producers for this good, some will choose not to. Finally, public goods are both\nnon-excludable and nonrival in consumption, the efficient quantity of this good can be\ndetermined by the social marginal benefit which is the sum of each consumer's individual\nmarginal benefits calculated all together.\nThe North Carolina chemical power plant and the pollution it causes on the residents, is a\nnegative externality in the market. In the New Y ork Times article they discuss how the Chemours\nchemical plant in North Carolina, dumping the waste in the river causes pollution(Hiroko,2024).\nThis shows a negative externality because the residents of North Carolina are experiencing an\nuncompensated cost even though they had nothing to do with dumping the chemical plant waste\nin the river. This means the social marginal cost is higher than the individual producers cost,\nmaking the equilibrium quantity less than the efficient quantity. In this case, the cost for society\nbecause of this pollution, which causes cancer and liver damage among other health problems, is\noutweighing the individual cost for Chemours.\nThere are ways to fix negative externalities in the market as well. In the government’s\nattempt to do this they can either focus on the externality or the market. In the case of pollution\nthey can impose tradable emission permits, which are licenses for companies to emit a certain\namount of pollutants which they can trade among themselves. The Fayetteville Plant has been\nrepeatedly fined for going over the emissions limits. However other ways they can help rectify\nthis problem is issuing a Pigouvian tax, which is based on the quantity of pollution emitted or by\nsetting better environmental standards in the state.\nWord Count:500\nWork Cited:\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “North Carolina 'Forever Chemical' Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N.

      "essay": "To: econ101classmate@umich.edu\nFrom: econ101student@umich.edu\nSubject: Market Failure\nHey Joe,\nThanks for your email, I would be happy to explain the concept of market failure to you. In general,\nmarket failure can be described as a misallocation of resources due to the market being inefficient. This\nmeans that when individuals make rational decisions for their own betterment, it does not result in the\nbest outcome for the greater population—a result of the market being out of equilibrium. There are\ndifferent causes for this, including externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce\ngoods, which I will explain.\nThe first cause is externalities, which occurs when the production or consumption of a good has\nunforeseen consequences for a third party. This consequence can be positive or negative— negative\nexternalities, such as pollution produced in the production of a good, create additional costs on society as\na whole, for example. Positive externalities, such as herd immunity granted by vaccinations, benefits\nother members of society beyond the vaccine recipients. These costs and benefits are not reflected in the\nmarket price, causing an inefficient allocation of resources.\nPublic goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they are available to all, and the\nconsumption of the goods does not reduce its availability. However, these goods are often under-provided\nwithin the market, as there is little incentive for supplies to produce public goods, due to its difficulty of\npricing.\nBy comparison, common resources are also non-excludable but are rivalrous, meaning the quantity of\ngoods available will diminish in accordance with consumption. When individuals act out of self interest to\nexploit such resources, they become depleted or damaged. An example would be individuals overfishing\nin certain areas, beyond a sustainable level.\nAn example of a market failure due to artificially scarce goods can be seen in the article titled,\n“FTC\nFinds Large Grocers Used Size to Stock Shelves During Pandemic”\n, by Liz Y oung, published by the Wall\nStreet Journal. In a recent report, it was uncovered that large grocery chains had utilized stricter delivery\nrequirements and fined vendors that did not comply, in order to dominate the distribution of pandemic\nsupplies. FTC Chair Lina Khan described the situation as follows,\n“Dominant firms used this moment to\ncome out ahead at the expense of their competitors and the communities they serve” (Y oung). This\ncategory of market failure is known as artificially scarce goods, or goods that are artificially limited in\nsupply rather than naturally driven by market forces. By dominating smaller suppliers, the bigger grocery\nchains are exercising monopolistic control, and dominating the distribution of pandemic supplies. It is\ntherefore within their ability to maintain high prices and limit the competition, creating an inefficient\nmarket.\nI hope the descriptions provided help you better understand the concept and causes of different market\nfailures.\nSincerely,\nEcon 101 Student\nWord Count: 470\nWorks Cited\nY oung, Liz.\n“FTC Finds Large Grocers Used Size to Stock Shelves during Pandemic.\n” The Wall\nStreet Journal, The Wall Street Journal, 21 Mar. 2024,\nwww.wsj.com/articles/ftc-finds-large-grocers-used-size-to-stock-shelves-during-pandemic-1db4c8\n70.",

      "essay": "The concept of market failure is relatively simple. Market failure is when a market on its\nown fails to produce the efficient quantity of a good. That is, the market will not produce the\ngreatest total surplus possible. There are many ways this can happen, and I wanted to share an\nexample of this with you.\nOne way that many markets fail is due to externalities. Externalities are the effects of\nproducing a good that are not directly related to the market for that good. Externalities can be\neither positive or negative and are most often the effects of a good on those who did not buy that\ngood. Because these effects are not on the buyer, they are “external” to the market. Those in the\nmarket do not consider these external costs or benefits, and therefore will purchase too much or\ntoo little of the good, causing deadweight loss. When externalities occur in a market, the most\ncommon way to get the market to the efficient point is with government intervention.\nThe article “The Planet Needs Solar Power. Can We Build It Without Harming Nature?”\ndiscusses an example of a negative externality in the solar panel market. Placing solar panels\ncomes with a cost to the animals in the areas where they are placed, because large swaths of land\nare fenced off and covered up with solar panels. When these areas are covered with solar panels,\nanimals lose their habitats. Habitat loss is the main cause of the large global decline in\nbiodiversity, which has become a crisis.\nBecause the effect of solar panels is not on those buying the panels, but on the wildlife in\nthe surrounding areas, those animals are not being considered when purchasing land to put solar\npanels on. This means that the external cost of the solar panel market is the cost to the wildlife\nthat lose their habitat when solar panels are placed. It also means that the social marginal cost is\ngreater than the producer’s marginal cost.\nThere are three different ways to solve a negative externality: Climate regulations,\nPigouvian taxes, and permits or quotas. Climate regulations only apply to the negative\nexternality of pollution, regulating the amount of pollution that can be produced. Pigouvian taxes\nare taxes meant to change behavior, so in this example those would be taxes on land in that area\nor taxes on solar panels. The last, and cheapest way to solve a negative externality is a permit or\na quota, which in our example would be a set limit on the number of solar panels that could be\nplaced in a certain area. If these are set at the right level, the producer’s marginal cost curve will\nrise to meet the social marginal cost curve, and the market will then produce the efficient\nquantity of solar panels.\nEinhorn, Catrin. “The Planet Needs Solar Power.

      "essay": "To: My Friend\nFrom: Y our Dearest Friend\nDear Friend,\nWhile the concept of market failure may seem confusing, by the end of this email I hope\nto help you better understand. Market failure is essentially when the market is not maximizing\nthe total surplus. What occurs is that the market's equilibrium does not fail in alignment with the\nefficient equilibrium. There is a variety of way in which this can occur. One example is without\nthe market even realizing. This would be an example of an externality. Externalities are\nessentially an external cost of benefit that an individual participating in the market is imposing\non those not associated with this particular market. As individuals participating in the specific\nmarket do not take into account their effect on a 3rd party, the market continues as normal. This\nleads to market failure as the market is failing to operate at its true efficient equilibrium.\nHowever, if the market were to internalize the effects they had on society, they would take into\naccount the external cost or benefit so that it would directly affect the decision makers,\nparticipants of these particular markets, choices.\nThis idea is often really abstract, so a real life example may be beneficial. Recently, there\nis talk about finding a methodology to turn concert cleaner. Concrete “is the second-most-used\nmaterial in the world after water” and it also accounts for almost 7% of carbon emissions on our\nearth (Putzier). The product is an extreme pollutant, as it beats even aviation in the amount of\ncarbon emissions destroying our earth. The market of concrete is a classic example of a negative\nexternality. When participants go to purchase concrete, they pay no mind to the pollution that is\nbeing caused by consuming this concrete. A similar effect happens on the producers side of the\nconcrete market. Their only concern is supplying enough for their consumers, not the amount of\ncarbon being emitted when making the concrete. Thus, the people involved in the market only\nfocus on their supply and demand. They do not realize their role in creating the pollution that is\naffecting millions of people not even participating in this market. The failure to internalize the\nexternal cost that pollution creates when making their decisions on how much they will supply or\ndemand, leads to the cement market working at an equilibrium that is inefficient. The everlasting\neffects and damage that carbon emissions have on the earth and peoples health costs a value\nhigher than simply buying cement. Therefore, we have a example of a market failure. The\namount of cement being sold and produced is higher and at a cheaper value than the efficient\namount that should be sold and produced.\nPlease reach out if you have any more questions\nThank you,\nY our Dearest Friend\nWord Count: 442\nWorks Cited\nPutzier, Konrad. “Concrete Is One of the World’s Worst Pollutants.

      "essay": "Dear friend, \nI’m so sorry to hear that you had to travel home for a family emergency; I hope everything is ok! I can help keep you up to date with the course work and concepts of Econ 101. We are currently learning about market failures. \n\tA market failure occurs when, absent intervention (even government intervention), the market fails to reach the efficient outcome, even in equilibrium. This means that the market does not maximize total surplus. We can measure the market’s failure by first identifying the total surplus at equilibrium. Next, we identify the efficient outcome, and finally we measure the difference between the total surplus at equilibrium and the efficient outcome, which is the deadweight loss. \n\tOne specific type of market failure is externalities, and there are negative and positive externalities. Negative externalities are an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm poses on others. This is also called an external cost. Negative externalities cause the market to under produce, and examples of negative externalities include overgrown front yards and pollution. Positive externalities are a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation. This is also called an external benefit. Positive externalities cause the market to overproduce, and examples of positive externalities include nice front yards and vaccinations. \nIn a New York Times article titled “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns”, a negative externality is discussed. The article discusses the increase in microplastics (small plastic particles) that are being found in the ocean (Jacobs, 2024). A very small amount of the plastic in plastic goods is actually recycled, while a large amount of plastic that is thrown away ends up in the ocean (Jacobs, 2024). Microplastics are being found in a wide range of living creatures, including the seafood people eat, which is negatively affecting people’s health, leading to market failure. In this particular negative externality, the third party being affected is people who decide to consume fish that may potentially have ingested harmful microplastics. This negatively affects the third party because microplastics can lead to poor health outcomes; “Nienke Vrisekoop, a microplastics researcher at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, said she found that immune cells that come in contact with microplastics die three times as quickly than those that do not” (Jacobs, 2024). Since it is clear that microplastics have a negative impact on an external third party, they are considered a negative externality. \nI hope all is well with your family, and I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have. \n\nBest, \nYour friend \n\n\n\n\nWord Count: 431  \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=2Links+to+an+external+site. \n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\n\nI am writing to you to help you understand this new idea of market failure from lectures this past week. The definition of a market failure is when absent of intervention the market fails to reach efficiency. Until this point in Econ 101 we have always assumed that the market equilibrium is the same as market efficiency but this is simply not true. A key way to differentiate equilibrium and efficiency is that equilibrium occurs when the marginal benefit of consumers equals the marginal cost of producers whereas efficiency occurs when the social marginal benefit equals the social marginal cost. Efficiency is when society’s total surplus or net gain is maximized. A market failure can occur for a lot of reasons including but not limited to externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. Despite this difference in the market there are ways to intervene in order to get to market efficiency. The government could intervene by placing a tax, quota, standard or subsidy on the goods or service to change the quantity. The other option is that both parties could meet, and negotiate in order to account for the discrepancy. \nTo help you better understand the idea of market failure in the real world, there was a New York Times article explaining that microplastics are accumulating in humans causing health issues. The article highlights a negative externality because the consumer and producers of microplastics are harming everyone, even those not consuming or producing the plastic. At the current equilibrium, the plastic industry is producing an annual quantity of 400 million metric tons of plastic, far exceeding the socially optimal level, as it fails to consider the costs to society (Jacobs, 2024). To maximize total surplus, the industry should produce a lower quantity. \nIn order to fix this market failure the government needs to intervene since both parties are too large to negotiate a way for them to take on the costs that they are placing on society. The government can either focus on the market or the externalities. In the case of the microplastics the government should focus on the pollution (or externality) since the size of the plastic market would be hard to regulate and enforce. The most effective way to solve this problem is either a Pigouvian tax (a tax on the pollution) or a tradable emission permit. Personally, I would recommend a tax based on the quantity of pollution emitted because it would incentivize producers to reduce pollution. The advantages of taxing the pollution would provide flexibility for businesses to choose how they reduce pollution, and target the specific plastic polluters that are making microplastics.\nI hope this explanation helps you understand what a market failure is, how to spot one in the real world and different ways to make the market efficient.\n\nSincerely, \nYour Classmate\n\nWord Count: 468\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times, March 9, 2024. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=3. \n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nOne of the most important elements of economics is market failure, particularly when it\nhappens naturally and without government or outside intervention. Market failure is when\ninefficiency arises in the market, leading to a smaller total surplus when compared to the\nefficient outcome, which is when total surplus is maximized. An inefficient outcome in the\nmarket means both producers and consumers see a decrease in the amount of surplus they could\nbe gaining, meaning that it is a negative effect on everyone involved within the market. There are\nmany causes of market failure, one being negative externalities, which are uncompensated costs\nin outside markets that have effects that impose themselves on other markets. A common\nexample of a negative externality is pollution, and it is considered a negative externality because\nit can be produced by several different markets and then it can affect alternative markets that\naren’t necessarily involved in this pollution production but still have to bear the negative\nconsequences of pollution. One example of market failure being caused by a negative externality\nis the electric grid market being unable to operate at maximum efficiency because of increased\nglobal temperatures and climate change. The negative externality at play here is pollution, which\nis being created in other markets as a byproduct, but still finding itself being incorporated in the\ncosts of the electricity market. Specifically, electric grids that are powered by solar energy are\nexperiencing more strain because of increased temperatures, specifically in the winter, often\ncausing malfunctions and decreased productivity (Penn). This means that producers have to take\non the external cost of pollution when producing electricity, leading to a higher cost of\nproduction, which means that the quantity of electricity from electric grids that is bought by\nconsumers is less. Since producers are forced to consider this increased cost, this becomes the\nnew social marginal cost, and when it intersects with the social marginal benefit curve, or the\ndemand curve, on the supply-demand graph, it is at a lower quantity than at the efficient\noutcome, which is when total surplus is maximized. So, since the market is now operating at a\nquantity that is less than the efficient quantity, deadweight loss arises, since now less consumers\nare buying electricity from this market and producers are unable to sell a larger quantity of\nelectricity because of the greater costs. All in all, both producers and consumers are losing on\nsurplus, meaning that there is overall loss in total surplus, which is all stemming from pollution\nthat is coming from other markets, which the electric grid market has to take into account even if\nit is not responsible for it.

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nSending well wishes to you and your family. I hope you will be able to return to class soon, but in the meantime, I can explain the concept of market failure to you. \nIn an ideal market scenario, when the market reaches equilibrium (when quantity demanded equals quantity supplied), society’s total net gain is maximized. Since total surplus is maximized in this scenario, the outcome is efficient. Market failure happens when, without any intervention (including government intervention), the market does not read the efficient outcome, even at equilibrium. Several concepts can play a role in market failure: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. There are two types of externalities. A positive externality is a benefit conferred on others without compensation. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that is imposed on others. In market equilibrium with a negative externality, the social marginal cost equals the sum of the producer marginal cost plus the external marginal cost. The external marginal cost at market equilibrium produces a negative total surplus. Failure to maximize total surplus occurs because the market equilibrium only considers the producers’ private marginal cost, failing to consider the societal external cost. Due to this external cost, the market fails to read where societal marginal benefit intersects societal marginal cost, so society’s total net gain is not maximized.\nTo illustrate the concept of a negative externality, I will use the market failure in the article “The Planet Needs Solar Power. Can We Build It without Harming Nature?” as an example. This article is about the negative effects of solar panel farms on nature. Animals need humans to solve climate change, but they also need a place to live. Solar panels present an ecological challenge because “up to a third of potential solar development in the United States could overlap with areas that have high value for wildlife movement, according to one study, as animals move to adapt to climate change” (Catrin). This overlap is a major issue because “loss of habitat is the top driver of a staggering global decline in biodiversity” (Catrin). Building solar panel farms in the American West is intended to protect nature by mitigating the climate crisis, however, it causes animal habitat loss. The market failure in this article is caused by the negative externality of animals losing habitat space. In the market for clean electricity, when the market reaches equilibrium, the outcome is not efficient. Total surplus is not maximized because producers and consumers fail to consider the negative externality of habitat loss. For instance, consumers who want to protect the environment would probably demand less solar energy relative to other forms of energy if they knew the negative impact solar farms have on biodiversity. The negative externality of the loss of animal habitat is not usually a cost accounted for in the market price of clean electricity. This discrepancy between the private and social costs leads to the overproduction of solar energy, thus creating a market failure.\nWord Count: 498\n \nWork Cited\nEinhorn, Catrin. “The Planet Needs Solar Power.

      "essay": "Hey Buddy,\nI hope all is well at home! Market failures are way less complicated than you think. Broadly, a\nmarket failure is when there exist inefficiencies within the market that result in unrepresented or\ndisplaced values and costs assigned to goods. Just as governmental controls such as price floors\nand price ceilings lead to inefficiencies in economics, market failures produce similar\ninefficiencies that can also be represented by deadweight loss! What helped me get the hang of it\nwas thinking about all the market failures we encounter daily––most notably, externalities! Read\nthrough this example of an externality,\n“North Carolina ‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates\nHuman Rights, U.N. Panel Says,”\n(https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/climate/pfas-forever-chemicals-north-carolina.html?searc\nhResultPosition=12Links to an external site.) and I will break it down.\nAs you read, this article discusses the dumping of untreated industrial waste containing the\n\"forever chemical,\" PFAS, into the Cape Fear River, making it unsafe for over 100 miles\ndownstream due to risk of cancer, liver damage, birth defects and other health problems. This\npollution by the Chemours chemical plants is a negative externality because, while Chemours is\nproducing goods for the consumer market, such as those used in the production of nonstick\ncookware, pizza boxes, water-repellent clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and carpets, firefighting\nfoam, and some cosmetics, they are ultimately imposing a cost on the surrounding community in\nthe form of health risks without compensation.\nSo, we have seen that if there is a social cost of a good on the population, that it is quantifiable\nand significant, but how does that appear in the context of what we have learned this semester?\nImportantly, we can plot externalities such as this one using our supply and demand curve. In this\ncase, however, we are interested in two extra lines on our graph: the Marginal Social Cost (MSC)\nin the case of negative externalities and the Marginal Social Benefit (MSB) in the case of\npositive externalities. In either case, externalities are defined by the triangular area between the\nAllocatively Efficient point, the Market Equilibrium point, and the True Social Cost of the\nquantity at that point. This is the deadweight loss, and represents the market inefficiency that\nmakes it a failure!\nInterestingly, the government can impose taxes or subsidies to help reduce the size of the\ndeadweight loss caused by market failures. For example, a product has high MSC, it can be taxed\nto help lower that cost, and if it has high MSB, it can be subsidized to ensure the public has\naccess to it.\nHope this helps and let me know how I can help you going forward!\nWORD COUNT: 444",

      "essay": "Hey,\nHope this email finds you well. Market failure must be a tough concept to handle while traveling\n— but it’s not as complicated as it seems, and I can clarify it for you!\nI found a recent article from The Guardian that really delves into market failure and what’s\nbehind it. This article is called The Reasons for The Housing Crisis Go Beyond The Green Belt,\nand it talks about the losses the UK housing market experiences.\nFirst, a market failure occurs when the free market fails to reach the efficient outcome, hence\nfailing to efficiently allocate resources and generate maximum total surplus for society. In this\nscenario, a combination of externalities, artificially scarce resources, and public goods\naccumulate into a housing crisis.\nThe article revolves around green belts and their role in urban planning. Established in 1955,\ngreen belts were attempts to prevent rapid urban expansion, assist in urban regeneration, protect\ngreenery, and preserve character of neighborhoods. Originally targeted for preserving the\nenvironment and small towns, unintended consequences arose in the housing market.\nFrom a housing perspective, green belts were cheap and easy to develop. When developers were\nfaced with complications of urbanization where land was extremely limited and expensive, they\nturned to these greenfield lands for housing. This preference for greenfield development led to a\nproliferation of housing on the outskirts of cities and a scarcity of housing in cities. This means a\nsurplus of housing in low-density areas and a shortage in urban areas, which further contributes\nto problems such as transportation inefficiency, urban sprawl, and overcrowding.\nThe article also underscores the role of developers in the housing crisis. Due to urbanization and\nexpensive resources, developers have been cutting costs in terms of designs and locations of\nhouses, essentially removing all affordable housing options. Because developers are\nmanipulating production costs, or marginal costs, there results a proliferation of luxury housing\nand a scarcity of affordable housing. Such profit-driven developments force low or\nmiddle-income families to disproportionately suffer the consequences of a market failure. Rather\nthan prioritizing profit, developers should be considering social housing initiatives that can\nalleviate the ongoing perpetual housing crisis in the UK.\nSocial housing initiatives refer to policies, either made by non-profit or government\norganizations, that aim to ensure affordable housing for all. The article points out a lack thereof,\nparticularly regarding government investment and support. Despite an intense need for\naffordable housing, governments have incentivized private development and privatization of\nhousing assets, allowing developers to maximize their profits. This calls for larger social issues\nsuch as the marginalization of certain communities, widening socioeconomic inequalities, and\neven homelessness, where a mass amount of people cannot afford suitable or sufficient housing.\nAll in all, the article states that the combination of a preference for greenfield land development\nand lack of social housing initiatives has led to a market failure where the population is\ndisproportionally affected.\nTo address such market failure, government policymakers and non-profit organizations must\nreconsider urban planning policies, social housing initiatives, and sustainable development.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/08/the-reasons-for-the-housing-crisis-go-beyond-\nthe-green-belt\nBest,\nIsabella",

We have covered a new topic known as market failure, which has proven to be a\nconfusing topic. I'm here to explain it with an article that has a pressing and up-to-date\nexample involving climate change and how it affects insurance.\nWhen the free market fails to distribute goods and services effectively, there is a net\nloss to social welfare. This is known as market failure. One of the main factors for\nmarket failure is externalities. Externalities are costs or benefits incurred by third parties\noutside of a transaction, without compensation.\nThis article talks about a market failure in the sense of how climate change is\ninfluencing the insurance industry. In the last few months, people have realized a huge\nincrease in the amount of and severity of disasters related to climate. Health and house\ninsurance has skyrocketed because of disasters like wildfires and extreme heat, This\nscenario is based on a negative externality, in which the market prices of fossil fuels, the\nmain cause of climate change, do not reflect the broader societal costs of climate\nchange, such as higher healthcare costs from increased illnesses and hospitalizations\ndue to extreme heat and air pollution.\nIt's been hard for these Insurance companies to prepare for these disasters because\ntheir traditional models cannot really tell what's going to happen with climate-related\nrisks. Because of this mismatch, insurance premiums do not accurately reflect the true\neconomic costs of climate hazards, creating a market failure in which individuals who\ncause climate change (by emitting greenhouse gases) do not fully bear the\nconsequences of their actions. Because of this, homeowners and health insurance\npolicyholders are now facing societal costs in the form of higher premiums.\nWhile it's not the main topic of this article, another quick example of a market failure\nthat is occurring is information asymmetry. Because insurers don't have enough\nhistorical data it is really hard for them to model future climate risks. This has made it\nreally hard to mitigate risks by implementing coverage adjustments or fairly adjusting\npremiums.\nThis has far-reaching effects on the public's capacity to obtain reasonably priced\ninsurance as well as the financial success of insurance businesses. This illustration\nhighlights the necessity of developing new methods for managing and modeling risks in\na changing environment, as well as possible legislative and policy measures to address\nthe externality of climate change.\nI hope this real-world issue of a negative externality helps you understand a clear\nexample of what a market failure can be. I know it's a very confusing topic, so I hope\nthis clear example of how economic theories apply to our everyday lives and the\nbroader societal challenges we face has helped.\nStay safe, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further\nexplanation on any topic.\nBest regards,\nYour Classmate\nKahn, Yusuf. “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nTo answer your questions about market failure, the basic definition is when the market\nfails to be efficient on its own without government intervention. This creates an inefficient\nallocation of resources since individuals (consumers or producers) are acting in a way that only\nbenefits themselves, not the society as a whole. (Dudley) The government can step in and fix the\nproblem through subsidies or taxes or it can be solved privately by producers and consumers.\nThere are a couple types of market failure. First, externalities are an indirect negative or positive\neffect on a third party from a producer or consumer producing engaging or with a good/service.\nAn example of a negative externality would be pollution from a producer harming an unrelated\nparty nearby and a positive externality might be free education since it’ll increase the number of\nhigher paying jobs, more educated citizens, etc. Another type of market failure would be from\nlack of public goods (when too many consumers are consuming a good without paying,\nremoving the incentive for private producers to continue producing).\nA recent real world example of a lack of public goods would be from this article about\nDisney+ limiting password sharing between their customers. Recently, they have had a problem\nwith free-riders, consumers who are benefiting from using the service without paying for it.\n(Dudley) So those are the people who are using Disney+ customers’ accounts who have paid for\nthe subscription without having to pay themselves. The Disney+ subscription is an artificially\nscarce good because they are excludable (you have to pay for it) but they are non-rival (it doesn’t\ncost the producer extra to provide one more unit of that good, meaning their efficient price of\nsupply is 0). Therefore, where the market failure comes in is when Disney+'s marginal cost of\nproviding the service is not being covered by the benefits they are receiving since it costs them\nmoney to produce or get ownership of the shows so if they aren’t receiving enough profit, then\nthey won’t be able to continue providing the service or will be forced to increase the price of\nsubscription to the point that not enough consumers are willing to pay such a high price. This\nmeans that the social marginal benefit (society’s benefit minus any costs) does not equal the\nproducers’ marginal cost and therefore is inefficient. (Dudley) So their solution was to try and\nlimit the free rider problem.\nFrom,\nY our friend\nWord count: 403\nWorks Cited:\nDudley, Mitchell, Types of Goods.

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nThanks for reaching out! I would be happy to explain market failures –\nhere’s an\nexample. Mira Cheng’s article “ALS Drug Fails Large Clinical Trial and May Be Withdrawn\nfrom Market” discusses how a large clinical trial testing efficacy of ALS medication has failed.\nShe explains that the drug did not outperform the placebo, causing a market failure in the drug\nmarket (Cheng). As a result, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals will be pulling the drug from the market\nto try to correct the failure (Cheng).\nDrugs and pharmaceuticals are non-rival and excludable in consumption, making them an\nartificially-scarce good. They are excludable because pharmacies can prevent people from\nconsuming the good if they do not pay for it. Goods that are non-excludable and non-rival\nencounter Free Riders –\nconsumers who enjoy the good without paying – one must pay to have\naccess to ALS drugs. As a result, this ALS medication is excludable. Rival in consumption\nmeans use by one person does not diminish the availability of the same good to another person\n–\nthe same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. A\ngood that is nonrival in consumption has an efficient price so low (usually zero) that everyone is\nable to have access to the good. Drugs and pharmaceuticals are non-rival because once the drug\nis developed, the marginal cost of producing another dose of the same drug is usually close to or\nis zero.\nThe market equilibrium is efficient when total surplus is maximized in the market. A\nmarket failure occurs when the market equilibrium is not efficient due to structural failures in the\nmarket, such as non-private goods, like artificially-scarce goods. When the ALS drug proves to\nbe ineffective, the market fails because the market efficiency is not being maximized. The drug is\nnot effective, therefore the buying and selling of the drug was not efficient or effective. There\nwas insufficient allocation of resources, meaning resources could have been more effectively\nused in the production of artificially scarce goods to better meet the needs of the consumer.\nTo correct this market failure, Amylyx Pharmaceuticals is pulling the drug from the\nmarket. Additional possible solutions include government intervention, regulation, or changes in\npolicy to correct inefficiencies and ensure that the market is operating efficiently and in the\npublic’s best interests. Some ideas include consumer protection laws, which ensure companies\nare clearly advertising product limitations and lack of information on the full effect of the drug,\nand supporting the drug market with additional government funded research and development.\nI hope this helps with your understanding of market failures,\nYour Friend\n437 Words\nWorks Cited\nCheng, Mira. “ALS Drug Fails Large Clinical Trial and May Be Withdrawn from Market.” CNN,\nCable News Network, 8 Mar. 2024, www.cnn.com/2024/03/08/health/als-drug-relyvrio-\nfails-trial/index.html.",

This\nmeans that the distribution of goods or services are not at perfect equilibrium like we see on a\nsupply and demand curve. This can be because of many different factors, such as: externalities,\ncommon resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods. Externalities are things that\nnegatively affect people outside of a market but the cost of the negative impact of the good or\nservice is not factored into the price of it. A common resource is a resource that is free for\neveryone all the time, but this results in the supply not being able to keep up with the demand for\na free resource, so the market is inefficient. A public good is something that is free to everyone,\nbut there is an unlimited supply so the supply never runs out. This is similar to a common\nresource because there are also free goods which mean the market is inefficient. An artificially\nscarce good is something that there is unlimited supply for but it needs to be paid for by the\nconsumer. This causes a market failure because there is an infinite supply but less demand due to\nthe price so the market is inefficient.\nTo help you to better understand the concept of market failure I have found a real world\nexample in an article from The Wall Street Journal. Written by Luis Garcia, the article titled\nSome Private-Equity Firms Stick with Natural Gas Despite Climate Concern, discusses the\nconsequences of some companies’ production of goods. While the main part of the article\ndebates the use of natural gas versus clean energy, the part of the article that I want to focus on is\nthe discussion of pollution. Both clean energy and natural gas and coal all produce some sort of\npollution whether it be to the air or light pollution, even the production of solar panels produces\npollution. Pollution is an externality because any form of pollution negatively impacts people\noutside of the market. In this private-equity firm example, these firms can cause air pollution\nwhich affects people all around the world despite not everyone in the world taking part in this\nmarket. Therefore, when pollution is not only produced against people who buy the product, this\nis an externality which means the market is not at its most efficient and it causes a market failure.\nI hope this helped you!\nBest Regards,\nName\nWord Count: 482\nReferences\nWSJ News Exclusive | Now for some good news about climate.

      "essay": "To: Friend\nSubject: Market Failures in ECON 101\nCurrently in ECON, we are learning about market failure: when market equilibrium does not produce the\nefficient outcome. So far in the course, we have assumed that market equilibrium achieves the efficient\noutcome, but this is not always the case. Recall, the efficient outcome occurs when total surplus is\nmaximized. This means that consumer and producer surplus are also maximized, but what happens when\nthe consumer negatively or positively affects others based on their actions? The total surplus experienced\nby society is different from the surplus experienced by the individual. Thus, the market equilibrium does\nnot produce the efficient outcome for society. When the consumption of one good provides benefit for\nothers, we call this a positive externality. On the other hand, when the consumption of one good produces\na cost for others, we call this a negative externality.\nLet’s apply these concepts to a real world situation: cars. Gas cars produce air pollution as they are driven,\nand this air pollution negatively affects society. Generally, we associate cars to produce some level of air\npollution, so the pollution itself is not necessarily considered a negative externality. Only cars that\nproduce excessive amounts of pollution (i.e. pick-up trucks, vans, etc.) have a negative externality\nassociated with them, since the negative externality represents the additional cost society takes. Thus, we\ncan identify a market failure within the market of gas vehicles.\nTaking this example a step further, a New York Times article Are You a Super Driver? Some States Want to\nHelp You Go Electric states,\n“the top 10 percent of motorists in the United States… account for roughly\none-third of the nation’s gasoline use”\n. This fact alone does not necessarily indicate a market failure,\nhowever there exist cars that do not use gasoline: electric vehicles. Suppose these 10 percent of motorists\nswitched to electric cars and trucks. The United States would consume much less gasoline and produce\nsignificantly less air pollution. Since society would not have to clean up this pollution later, it is saved\nfrom the expected cost of a gas car. Therefore, electronic vehicles provide a positive externality. In fact,\nthis positive externality is provided by all consumers of electric vehicles, but we gain a disproportionately\nlarger benefit when “Super Drivers” consume and use an electric vehicle. Since we are able to identify an\nunaccounted positive externality in the market for electric vehicles, there exists a market failure.\nBibliography:\nPlumer, Brad. “Are Y ou a Super Driver?

      "essay": "Dear V alerie,\nMarket failure is the inefficient distribution of goods and services such that the quantity\nof supply is unequal to the quantity demanded. This can be caused by a variety of different\nfactors, including externalities, common resources, public goods, artificially scarce goods,\nmonopolies, and oligopolies. However, we have not yet covered monopolies or other forms of\nimperfect competition.\nExternalities can be positive or negative. Negative externalities are uncompensated costs\nimposed on an individual, while positive externalities are benefits given to an individual without\ncompensation. Public goods, such as public health, education, and so on, are either given without\ncompensation or subsidized by the government. Finally, artificially scarce goods are goods that\none can live without and that lack competition.\nPoverty and unemployment are both results of market failure. In 2022, continuing into\n2024, New Y ork City has seen a steep incline in poverty. Nearly two million people are living in\npoverty (Chen, S). This results from the discontinuation of public goods and unequal immobility\nin the labor industry. During the coronavirus, government aid provided more easily accessible\nand higher-paying programs that targeted inflation, unemployment, and living costs. It is also\ndue to an unequal recovery in the labor market. The local government claims to have restored all\njobs that were lost during the pandemic, but many of these jobs provide low wages. While the\nretail sector has laid off more employees than any other industry, the home health care sector has\nundergone a massive growth, though it pays nearly $12,000 less.\nPublic goods, such as health care and welfare programs, must achieve stability in order to\nprevent market failure. The government increased the budget for welfare programs during the\npandemic but has since discontinued them. This discontinuation, along with an unstable recovery\nin the labor industry, has harmed marginalized groups and pushed more than 500,000 people into\npoverty in the last two years – in New Y ork City alone (Chen, 2024). As many individuals have\nnot been able to recover the salary of their pre-coronavirus jobs, the discontinuation of welfare\nprograms that assisted families with rent costs and unemployment compensation has created a\nmarket failure in public goods and labor now that there is no longer a need to provide\ncoronavirus welfare programs. Instead, new ones must be created.\nAnother aspect of poverty in New Y ork can be attributed to market failure in the labor\nindustry. At first glance, the labor market has recovered from COVID-19, with an equal amount\nof jobs as before the pandemic (Chen, 2024). However, the labor market has recovered mostly in\nlow-paying industries, not allowing those who lost their jobs to earn equal salaries before\nunemployment.\nWord Count: 441\nCitation\nChen, S.

      "essay": "First Draft Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nDear Econ 101 Classmate,\nMarket failure is an interesting and important topic we learned about in class while you\nwere away. Market failure relates to prior concepts we learned in class that you would be\nfamiliar with, such as market equilibrium and efficiency. Up until this point, we assumed that\nmarket equilibrium was efficient at allocating goods. However, we learned this is only partially\ntrue, specifically for only one type of goods. These are known as private goods and they have\ntwo qualities: they are excludable and rivals in consumption. Examples of these goods are houses\nand beef, and these have the potential to be efficient at the market equilibrium.\nHowever, other types of goods cannot be efficiently allocated, even at market\nequilibrium. These goods are common resources, artificially scarce goods, and public goods.\nEach of these goods is either non-excludable, non-rival in consumption, or both, and the\ngovernment usually has to intervene somehow to maximize efficiency. The government has\nseveral tactics to do this which I will discuss further, however the end goal is to make Social\nMarginal Benefit equal to Social Marginal Cost. Social Marginal benefit is just the sum of all\nindividual consumers marginal benefit from each unit. To better illustrate market failure, I will\ndiscuss common resources, which is an increasingly relevant example of a market failure.\nThe article which I have linked below is a great example of how a common resource can\nbe a market failure. The common resource in question is clean air, and it is non-excludable\nbecause nobody can be prevented from using it. Clean air can also be considered a rival in\nconsumption because when the atmosphere is polluted with CO2, the quality of air can diminish\nfor others, so the actions of one entity can affect the utility for others. Specifically, the problem\nof non-exclusivity causes a problem known as the free-rider problem, where the air can be\nconsumed by anyone without paying a price. This article highlights this specific problem because\nit reports that global CO2 emissions hit a record high in 2023. It cites that the emissions of\nmainly China and India are the main contributors to this despite advanced economies emissions\nfalling by 4.5% last year (Petroni 2024). In terms of this class, this is a market failure because the\nsocial marginal cost is exceeding the individual marginal costs, therefore causing the market to\noveruse the common resource. Governments have been intervening to correct this inefficiently\nhigh quantity of CO2 being produced. The most common government intervention is CO2 taxes,\nand these are a type of Pigouvian taxes. These are designed to maximize efficiency by reducing\nthe quantity of CO2 being produced. Another common government intervention is through\nsubsidizing renewable energy, which increases the quantity of energy being produced from\nrenewable sources. This would in turn decrease the reliance on fossil fuels and in turn lower the\nquantity of CO2 being produced.\nWord Count: (482)\nWorks Cited\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/global-co2-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2023-iea-says-ea522461?\nmod=global_more_article_pos2",

      "essay": "Hello Friend, \nI would love to break down market failure for you!\nMarket failure is a situation where there is an inefficient distribution of goods and services on the free market. Market failure is caused by externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. Externalities are uncompensated costs or benefits that firms impose on parties who are not consumers of the product or service the firm produces. Artificially scarce goods are non-rival but excludable goods. This causes efficiency problems, as the marginal cost would be zero. Common resources are non-excludable but rival. These resources are available to everyone but decrease in value or quantity the more people use them. Lastly, public goods are nonrival and nonexcludable because services are provided to everyone in society, at no cost, which can lead to free riding. \nEpipens and plastic pollution are market failures. According to a New York Times article, epipens, inhalers, and insulin pens have a large impact on the environment (Ted Alcorn, 2024). Negative externalities describe a situation where a good or service harms parties who aren’t involved. When negative externalities are present the social marginal cost exceeds the marginal private cost, and the equilibrium quantity will be higher than the efficient quantity, which may result in excess production. On the other hand, positive externalities helps a third part inadvertently, the marginal private benefit is less than the social benefit. Therefore the equilibrium quantity will be less than the efficient quantity, which can lead to underproduction. Single use medical products that lead to plastic pollution are considered as a negative externality, bystanders are negatively impacted by climate change due to overproduction of plastic, even if they don't use the medical products. The prices of these medical products do not accurately represent the cost of the pollution, and consumers aren’t charged the full cost of the negative effects of pollution. As a result, plastic pollution will negatively affect the ecosystem due to excessive use of these products. \nWhen thinking about the graph of the single-use medical product market, the demand curve represents the consumer’s marginal benefit, and the supply curve represents the producer’s marginal expense. Due to the negative externalities caused by pollution, there is an additional line called the social marginal cost. The social marginal cost is the cost to society as a whole, for producing one further unit. Since there is a negative externality, the external cost adds to the producer’s marginal cost. Since there is no positive externality, the consumer’s marginal benefit is equal to the social marginal benefit. \nThe efficient quantity is where the consumer’s marginal benefit equals the social marginal cost. Total surplus isn’t maximized, so this is classified as market failure. There is a positive total surplus between demand and social marginal cost, and deadweight loss is associated with market equilibrium. To fix this negative externality the government should impose a tax on these medical products that is equivalent to the external cost of the negative externality.\nWord count: 492\nWork cited: \nAlcorn, Ted. “Your Inhalers and EpiPens Aren’t Very Healthy for the Environment.” The New York Times, February 26, 2024. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/health/insulin-pens-inhalers-plastics-recycling.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

First off, market failure occurs when, absent any intervention (even government intervention), the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even in equilibrium. Here, 'efficient' means achieving maximum total surplus, which we learned previously happened at market equilibrium (These changes at market failure). Externalities, Market Power, and Non-Private Goods can be the reason for the market failure. However, I understand that these conceptual explanations alone might not make it easy to understand the situation.\n\tA recent article I read in The New York Times titled \"Nearly Half the States Sue E.P.A. Over New Limits on Deadly Pollution\" could greatly aid your understanding of this concept. The article discusses a lawsuit filed by 24 states against the Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.) regarding new regulations that aim to reduce fine industrial particle pollution. The E.P.A. has introduced a rule to lower the permissible levels of particle pollution to nine micrograms per cubic meter from 12, citing that such a reduction could prevent 4,500 premature deaths annually and yield up to $46 billion in health benefits. However, the states contesting the rule argue that it would increase manufacturing costs. Did you find what market failure happens here? The market failure identified here is \"negative externalities\", which is the case of \"pollution\", an uncompensated cost that a firm imposes on others. Pollution is not considered during the exchange in market but there will be a cost to purify this pollution. This uncompensated cost ultimately generates External Marginal cost, making the total surplus smaller at market equilibrium than it would be when social marginal benefit intersects with social marginal cost (This is \"efficient\"). Moreover, in this article, Government intervention can be seen as a way to address the market failure caused by negative externalities. That is, environmental standards to protect the environment by specifying actions by producers. I hope this example helps you understand the concept of market failure and how negative externalities play a key role in such scenarios. \n\tThe balance between economic activities and their societal impact is delicate, and understanding these imbalances is crucial in economics. Market failure is a key concept in economics and understanding this concept will help you learn other concepts more easily!

      "essay": "Dear classmate, \nI would love to help you understand the concept of market failure, which can be characterized as an inefficient allocation of resources in a particular market. It is important to understand that we can only say that this inefficient allocation occurs when the market fails to maximize total surplus. Up to this point, we assumed that a market in equilibrium maximized total efficiency, but now we have to acknowledge that even at our equilibrium quantity and price, there can be an effect on a third party which the market ignores in reaching an equilibrium. Therefore, we can measure a market failure by examining the difference in surplus between an efficient outcome and a market equilibrium. We all exist in a community, meaning that not only the people participating in market transactions will be impacted, and we can call this impact an externality; a cost or benefit incurred on a non market-engaged third party. \n\tContempararily, pollution is a very common form of an externality that we consistently observe resulting from production of goods and services. Pollution, an example of a negative externality, has potential to affect a multitude of people outside the scope of the market, and is becoming an increasingly worrisome issue. Many times we can observe the effects of pollution on communities neighboring industrial facilities or areas where means of transporation is abundant. For example, in recognizing the external cost of transportation, we can observe the government’s quandary regarding the expansion of highway transit. Many cities in our country are expanding in population, and the government is forced to recognize the effect on a third party; neighboring communities forced to breathe increasingly polluted air. \n\t The market on its own cannot handle an externality, and we can observe the implications of this discussion that are considered regarding recent proposals to expand highways in major cities like Portland and Houston. Shannan Osaka examines the effect of increased highway congestion and identifies the existence of a external social marginal cost. In recognizing the fact that any expansion of transportation facility will increase a byproduct of pollution for adjacent residents, we can determine a direct cause and effect relationship between the market’s quantity of road supplies and pollution from cars. An uncompensated is imposed by the company or firm expanding the highway, and we can determine that since our supply curve shifts up due to increased marginal cost, our efficient quantity of highway material is actually less than the quantity demanded and supplied in market equilibrium. Our efficienct quantity is deemed ‘efficient’ because this is the quantity that maximizes total surplus by acknowledging costs to all individuals affected by a company or firms actions. In our examination of pollution, we assume that the right quantity of pollution is 0, recognizing the absence of any positive effect. Osaka recommends that when producers ignore an external cost like pollution, we can determine a departure from the traditional effect of a market equilibrium, while outside individuals are negatively affected. \n\n\nOsaka, S.

      "essay": "Market failure occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome with no type of\nintervention (such as from the government). The market is efficient when the maximum total\nsurplus is reached, so when the market does not maximize total surplus, that is what is referred to\nas market failure. Total surplus is defined as society’s net gain from the market. If we think of a\nmarginal benefit vs. marginal cost graph, the net gain would occur where marginal benefit\nintersects with marginal cost (in other words, where they are equal to each other). It is important\nto note, though, that efficiency is often not equal to equilibrium. In order to measure market\nfailure, we must first identify the total surplus, as well as the efficient outcome. We then measure\nthe difference between the two - this would be the deadweight loss. We intend to minimize the\ndeadweight loss in order to maximize the total surplus, but in a market failure, this would not be\nthe case.\nThese inefficiencies in the market are most often caused by externalities, which is where\nan unrelated third party is affected by something in the market, and can be either positive or\nnegative. For example, in this article from the New Y ork Times, we can see how the current state\nof the housing market has affected unrelated markets. High mortgage rates and real estate prices\nhave resulted in the recent slowing of the housing market, however, that is not all being affected.\nThe article points out the negative effects that the recent housing market has had on its\ncomplements in consumption, which include storage businesses, furniture and appliance sales,\nand home improvement retailers. Storage businesses are often used by individuals that are\nmoving from one house to another and need a place to store their belongings. When people buy\nnew homes, many consider upgrading their appliances, furniture, and home decor. Although\nnone of the aforementioned businesses are directly involved in the real estate market, they are\ncomplements in consumption, and therefore their own markets slow alongside the real estate\nmarket. Because of this, those complements in consumption are negatively affected. This is\ncalled what we would refer to as a negative externality in the market - a third party being\naffected (in this case, negatively) by another source in the market. Since this externality prevents\nthe complements from thriving within their respective markets, those markets are unable to\nachieve the most efficient outcome. Therefore, it would be described as a market failure, because\nthey fail to maximize total surplus.\nWord Count: 424\nReferences\nWhite, M. C. (2024, January 1).

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIn response to your request for understanding market failures, I would be happy to give you a\nrundown. By definition, a market failure is essentially a situation in which the free market,\noperating on its own, does not distribute resources efficiently, leading to a loss of economic\nwelfare. Basically, the efficient allocation of resources is not achieved, which causes producers\nand consumers o t be worse off than they could be with a different allocation.\nTo further explain this concept I’m going to focus on “externalities” which is an external cost or\nbenefit that results from a certain activity that affects a third party who did not intend to receive\nthat cost or benefit. An example of a positive externality would be mowing lawns. Not only does\nit make your lawn look better, but it can actually benefit your neighbor's mood and home value\nsince looking at a well-kept lawn is nice. A negative externality could be producing cars, which\nis great for consumers to buy, however, this process produces toxic pollution, negatively\naffecting air quality and potentially leading to sickness. These are both unintended effects that\nwe don’t consider at first glance.\nI’m going to break down this news article I found about electric cars and how they have a\nnegative externality of pollution associated with their use as an example. Initially, we would\nthink of electric cars as having a positive externality associated with them since they reduce\ntailpipe emissions, however, since eclectic car batteries are so heavy they cause more wear on the\nrubber tires. As the tires wear down, they release tiny toxic particulate pollution that can cause\nharm to humans and the environment. We can also take into account that the production of\nelectric cars is incredibly unsustainable and causes many pollutants to be released into the air,\ncausing humans and the environment to become ill.\nIn economic terms, this would mean that the supply curve shifts upwards to a new price and\nquantity. Originally, the market price or “equilibrium” represents the cost the private producers\nincur in producing the good or service which in this case is electric cars. When the supply curve\nshifts upwards the social marginal cost creates a new optimal quantity where the price rises and\nthe quantity supplied decreases. Here the government needs to intervene and implement a\npollution tax on the electric car producers to reduce the consumption and production of electric\ncars. Since the cars emit particulate pollution, the cost of polluting must be accounted for, so the\ngovernment essentially says to the producer “Y ou need to pay for all that damage you’re causing\nfrom the pollution.” This way the price reflects the full cost of production including the\nexternality.\nTo summarize, a market failure is when the market fails to allocate goods and services in an\nefficient or fair way. This article shows how a seemingly positive product can still have negative\neffects on the market.\nHope this helps!\nBest,\nStudent",

Please know that if you need anything at all, whether it's related to Econ 101 or anything else, I'm here for you.\n\nSpeaking of Econ 101, let's delve into a concept you've mentioned feeling uncertain about: \"market failure.\" It's a pivotal topic, and I'm here to assist you in grasping it better.\n\nMarket failure occurs when the free market system doesn't efficiently allocate goods and services, leading to a misallocation of resources. One of the primary reasons behind market failure is externalities, which are costs or benefits affecting parties who didn't choose to incur them.\n\nTo elucidate this concept, let's analyze an insightful article from Business Insider titled \"Disney+ is cracking down on password sharing, a market failure that could cost it billions,\" published on February 29, 2024. You can access the article here (https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-2024-2).\n\nThe article vividly illustrates how Disney+ is grappling with a pressing challenge: individuals sharing passwords to access their streaming service. According to the article, \"The company is reportedly considering various options to address the issue, including limiting the number of devices that can be logged in simultaneously and requiring users to verify their identity more frequently.\" (Business Insider)\n\nFurthermore, the article emphasizes that \"The practice of password sharing poses a significant threat to Disney's revenue stream\" (Business Insider). This scenario starkly exemplifies market failure, as individuals sharing passwords fail to directly contribute to Disney's revenue, resulting in a substantial loss. Moreover, the article warns that \"If the company doesn't take action to address the issue, it could lose billions of dollars in potential revenue\" (Business Insider).\n\nThe role of externalities in this market failure becomes evident when we consider the broader impact. By sharing passwords, individuals derive benefits from the service without bearing the costs, thereby undermining the sustainability of the streaming service model. This not only affects Disney+ but also poses challenges for other streaming services facing similar predicaments.\n\nMoreover, this scenario encapsulates the essence of public goods. While streaming services offer entertainment that benefits society as a whole, the act of password sharing undermines the sustainable provision of this service.\n\nIn conclusion, this article serves as a poignant example of market failure, shedding light on how externalities and public goods intersect to create inefficiencies in the market.\n\nI hope this detailed analysis aids in clarifying the concept of market failure for you.

I'm committed to supporting you in navigating through Econ 101 and beyond.\n\nTake care,\nMia C.\n\nWord count: 447\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWORKS CITED \n\n●\tBusiness Insider. \"Disney+ is cracking down on password sharing, a market failure that could cost it billions.\" Business Insider, 29 Feb. 2024, https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-2024-2.\n",

I understand that you need help with some of the Econ 101 concepts we covered in class, so I’m sending this email with hopes that it serves you well. \nTo begin, we are discussing market failure in class. Essentially, market failure is when the market ceases to be efficient, through the misallocation of goods and services in the market. I have given you an article from the New York Times, titled “Plastic Pollution: A Growing Threat to Human Health.” In this article, you can see how various aspects can lead to market failure. Mainly, externalities- unintended costs or benefits that affect third party members of society, such as pollution or overgrown lawns- can lead to market failure. \nWe see the issue of externalities on the market in this article, through the lens of invasive microplastic pollution and its potential health impacts on humans. Even more, it focuses on how microplastics have even been found in various internal environments in the human body. Externalities also pose other arguments, such as potential benefits. While plastics have undoubtedly brought benefits to society, such as cheap and durable goods, it can be argued that they pose larger costs than their benefits. \nThe market failure brought up in this article is how the market failed to account for the true social and environmental costs of plastic and its production byproducts. For instance, whichever companies produce/manufacture plastic (and their consumers) may not take into account long-term consequences of plastic production. This leads to both overconsumption and the inefficient allocation of various factors of the market, including waste management or pollution-control efforts.\nMore about the negative costs associated with microplastics, their presence in internal body systems are associated with plastic production, in addition to external biome environments. The existence of microplastics in our oceans, air, and soils, pose risks to not only humans but other biological creatures. Risks mainly include adverse health effects,with the article highlighting cardiovascular harms and inflammation. \nTo sum up, the article explains how externalities in the production of plastic have led to a market failure. I understand how the concept is confusing, but I hope the article helped with understanding a more broad concept of market failure and its relation to economic inefficiency\n If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask.

      "essay": "Dudley\n25 March 2024\nEcon 101\nWriting Assignment #3 – Market Failure\n\nDear friend,\n\n\tIn an ideal world, the market operates efficiently at the market equilibrium point, but what happens when the market fails? Market failure is when the market acts at an inefficient point—either above or below the equilibrium point. \n\tA market can fail when it does not take the side effects of a decision into account; this is called an externality. Since the market does not account for the externalities, the market does not generate the maximum total surplus. Externalities are positive or negative. For example, if there was a beautiful home on the market, but the home was next to a house with an unmanicured lawn, the property would sell for less than it was worth. This side effect is a negative externality since the untrimmed landscape would present a cost for the neighboring property. Conversely, if the property was in a neighborhood of homes with manicured lawns and fresh paint, the house could be sold for more than what it was worth. This is an instance of a positive externality since the home is receiving a benefit as a side effect of the neighboring homes. Additionally, the externality may be internalized using the Coarse Theorem; in other words, the person who is causing the costs pays those affected. However, the theorem is unrealistic since it is related to transaction costs. Transaction cost is the cost of bringing all parties together. In an instance such as the neighborhood, the Coarse Theorem is more feasible since a neighborhood meeting could be called to settle a price, but in the real world, parties in the past and the future would be affected, and it is impossible to meet with those parties. Moreover, governments can correct externalities and bring the market to efficiency using quotas, taxes, permits, etc. These tools would correct the externality and bring the market to efficiency. \n\tLike the example, property values are an easy place to spot externalities. Typically, homes near unsafe environments or eyesores are lower in value than those in prime locations. In the city of Hamburg, NY, citizens attempt to transform their water tower into an attraction rather than a detraction. Currently, the water tower acts as a negative externality; grey, chipped, and weathered, the water tower stands as an eyesore for the community. In an article written by Joseph Pisani for the Wall Street Journal, a citizen of Hamburg notes that he has asked the city to tear it down since he can see the “drab” structure from the windows in his home (par 19). By painting the water tower to look like a hamburger, the city hopes to capitalize on its name and turn its negative externality into a positive one. The bright and unique design will raise the price of properties in Hamburg, drawing people in and creating a benefit to living in the town.\n\t\nI hope this helps your understanding of market failure and externalities.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Friend\n\n(484 Words)\n\nWork Cited\nPisani, Joseph. “Will a Giant Burger in the Sky Draw Tourists to This Sleepy Town?” The Wall Street Journal, 11 Mar. 2024, https://www.wsj.com/us-news/burger-water-tower-tourism-hamburg-new-york-9a61673a?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1Links to an external site..

      "essay": "To: Econ 101 Classmate\nFrom: Econ Friend\nSubject: A deeper dive into Market Failures\nHello, hope all is going well. I heard that you are confused on the topic of market\nfailures, and wanted to get a deeper dive on it. A market failure can occur when there is no\nmarket/government intervention, leading the market to fail to reach an efficient outcome. With\nthis, the market does not maximize total surplus, even at equilibrium.\nIn society, there are many market failures, including negative and positive externalities,\npublic goods, artificially scarce goods, and even common resources. However, this does not\nprovide a definite example of a market failure in our daily lives, with that I would like to present\nan article published by CNN about the new flu vaccine. This example of a market failure is a\npositive externality, defined as a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without\nreceiving compensation (Dudley 2024). Positive externalities do not just include vaccines, but\nthey can include things such as a well-maintained front yard and education. In this article, the\nspecific market failure identified would be the people who take the vaccine, as they do not\nrealize the social implications of the new flu vaccine. People take it to either protect themselves\nfrom the virus or as a work complaint. Many people disregard the fact that when they take the\nvaccine, they protect others as well from getting that same virus, even though those other people\nmight not take it, creating an external benefit.\nWith this, you might ask why this is considered a market failure. In the market for\nvaccines, at equilibrium, there are too few units of the good compared to the efficient level. With\nthis, since we fail to account for the externality, it does not generate as much total surplus as\npossible (Dudley 2024). To ultimately get to the efficient level, we must shift demand to the right\nto offset the “too little” of the goods we have. If this were a negative externality, we would shift\nsupply left as we were overproducing. With this now, our social marginal benefit, which is\nconsumer and external marginal benefit, is higher than consumer marginal benefit, intersecting\nproducer marginal cost at the efficient point. In a positive externality, there is going to be\ndeadweight loss associated with the market equilibrium because the marginal social benefit is\ngreater than the marginal social cost.\nHowever, there are ways to pursue efficiency in the market to help correct this\nexternality. With a positive externality, the government can subsidize the vaccine, as they realize\nit prevents both multiple strains of the flu and even COVID-19, protecting people who take it\nand those who cannot, reaching an efficient outcome. However, in reality, this might not be\npossible due to the Coase theorem. This theory states that with externalities an economy can\nalways reach an efficient solution, provided that the transaction costs of making a deal are\nsufficiently low (Dudley 2024). We cannot do this due to the normally high transaction costs\nassociated with certain externalities and how uncertain we are about them.\nSincerely,\nEcon 101 Classmate\nURL: https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/05/health/flu-vaccine-yamagata-strains/index.html\nCitations\nDudley, M.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment #3\n\nDear Keisha,\n\n\tI heard that you’ve been struggling with the concept of Market failure. That’s okay because after reading this email, you are sure to be a pro at market failure. Simply put, market failure is when the market doesn't work as perfectly as we'd like, leading to inefficient outcomes. This is usually because the price of a good doesn’t reflect its true value or cost of itself. This is explained by the concepts of externalities and types of goods. Externalities are costs/benefits that are a result of the market that are not associated with the direct exchange of that good if, for example, we look at a product market. A negative externality is when the market has underlying costs from said product that isn’t covered in the price. A common example of this would be pollution as it damages the environment/people/animals, and the costs of those damages are not covered in that price. Similarly, A positive externality is when the market has underlying benefits. A common example is a vaccine as vaccinated people don’t spread the virus they get vaccinated for, protecting those who aren’t vaccinated since they can’t spread it. The benefit that the non-vaccinated people get is not included in the equilibrium price. The type of good also can create a market failure. For example, a public good is available to anyone and free. This makes it less incentivizing for firms/producers to produce these goods, hence why usually the government provides it. Another example is common resources as it is free but limited. This causes consumers to become more inclined to use it more because it may run out soon.\n\tAlright, now let’s look at a real example of market failure that is recent. In the New York Times article titled, “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns” I believe we can see an example. The main argument of this article is that microplastics, created from plastic degradation, have severe health effects on the environment, animals, and even humans. This is shown within statements like, “…patients with plastic-infused plaque were 4.5 times as likely to experience a heart attack, stroke or death compared with those whose plaque was free of microplastics” or “…scientists began to discover microplastics embedded in a wide range of living creatures, including in the seafood we eat” (Jacob, 2024). So how is this a market failure exactly? Well, in this article we are talking about the plastic market, which has its equilibrium price and quantity. Consumers of this product buy and dispose of this product, which degrades into microplastics. As we now know, microplastics have severe health implications and this can cause people to become ill. Ill people need medical attention and medical bills are not cheap. Therefore, we can see this as a negative externality because the price of plastic in the market doesn’t cover the cost of a medical bill caused by this product. \nThat is all I have for market failure. I hope it is much easier to understand now. \n\nBye Keisha,\nYour friend\n\nWord count: 498\n \nWorks Cited\nJacobs, A. (2024, March 9). Microplastics are a big problem, a new film warns.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nThe topic of market failure that was covered in class was complicated, but I have no\nproblem explaining the concept of market failure and providing a real life example to improve\nyour understanding.\nFirstly, for a market to fail, it means that a free market does not reach its efficient\noutcome; or it fails to reach its efficient outcome. Keep in mind that a free market is one that\ninvolves no government intervention, and an efficient outcome is when total surplus is\nmaximized in the market.\nIn class, Dr. Dudley discussed numerous market failures: externalities, public goods,\ncommon resources, and artificially scarce goods. The market failure I will be explaining is\nexternalities because that particular one appears in the article.\nExternalities are the side effects of an activity that affects bystanders whose interests are\nnot taken into account (Krugman 466). Externalities can be either negative or positive.\nNegative externalities happen when an act inflicts costs on third parties which lead to\nmarket failures because, at market equilibrium, those costs are not being taken into account. In\nthe presence of negative externalities, social marginal costs exceed private marginal costs,\nmeaning that the market is producing more of the good than the market efficient quantity.\nPositive externalities happen when an act creates benefits for third parties. Although they\ncreate benefits, they still lead to market failure because, at the market equilibrium, those benefits\nare not being taken into account. In their presence, social marginal benefits exceed private\nmarginal benefits, meaning that the market is not producing enough of the good.\nAt Wall Street Journal article, “Why It Feels Like Everyone Y ou Know Is Getting\nCovid-19,” features a market failure of a positive externality: vaccines. The article discusses how\nthe new Covid-19 variant was going around and doctors across the country were urging people to\nget vaccinated, but only 19% of the U.S. were vaccinated. V accinations help reduce the spread of\na virus as they build immunity. The act of receiving a vaccine is an economic activity whose\nbenefits have an effect on all people, even the ones not vaccinated, making it a positive\nexternality.\nIn order to address this market failure, one would have to consider private and social\nmarginal benefits and see if the social marginal benefits are exceeding the private marginal\nbenefits. In this case, the social marginal benefits are not exceeding the private marginal benefits\nbecause not enough people are considering the advantages of receiving the vaccine. A positive\nexternality fails because people are undermining the influence that the benefits have on people\naround them. Here, the U.S. residents were not considering how being vaccinated helps people\nwho cannot be vaccinated.\nA solution to correct this market failure is to subsidize the vaccines. This subsidy would\nraise the private marginal benefits to meet the social marginal benefits, which encourages people\nto get vaccinated. To combat this failure, the system would increase the market quantity to the\nefficient quantity which corrects the externality.\nSincerely,\nY our friend\nWord limit: 498 words\nWorks Cited\nAbbott, Brianna, and Jon Kamp. \"Why It Feels Like Everyone Y ou Know Is Getting Covid-19.\"\nWsj.com, 5 Jan. 2024,\nwww.wsj.com/health/healthcare/covid-variant-jn1-dominates-new-cases-5cefd5ed?mod=\nSearchresults_pos18&page=1.

      "essay": "‭ Dear Lou Koumathes,‬\n‭ Thanks for reaching out to me with your questions about market failure! I’d be happy to‬\n‭ clear some things up, but the best way I think I can do that is by introducing some fundamentals‬\n‭ that are less abstract and walking you through an example. Before we start, market failure‬\n‭ essentially refers to a situation where a market, without outside intervention, fails to reach‬\n‭ efficiency. While all markets have an equilibrium, it is not accurate to always assume that the‬\n‭ efficient relationship between supply and demand occurs in line with equilibrium. This is due to‬\n‭ a concept called externalities– benefits or costs not included in the calculation of supply and‬\n‭ demand in a market. As a result, the market cannot balance out costs not included in how‬\n‭ equilibrium is achieved. Remember, the efficient outcome is the point where total surplus is‬\n‭ maximized, and the market does not always gravitate towards efficiency due to certain external‬\n‭ factors.‬\n‭ Every market centers around a good, and that good’s characteristics can determine a lot‬\n‭ of how the market operates and changes. Take the fishing industry from this‬‭ Forbes Magazine‬\n‭ article‬‭ for instance. The two main factors that govern the type of good that a market surrounds is‬\n‭ its excludability and if it is a rival in consumption. A good is excludable if producers can ensure‬\n‭ that only paying customers receive the product, and rival in consumption if only one person can‬\n‭ consume the good simultaneously or at all. In the case of fish, it is non-excludable, as the same‬\n‭ fish can be purchased from other companies, and it is rival in consumption because once a fish is‬\n‭ caught and sold, it cannot be caught, sold, or consumed again. Consequently, each fishing‬\n‭ company has to compete for the same fish, but cannot keep other companies from fishing in the‬\n‭ same waters. This classifies fish as a common resource, a type of good whose markets often face‬\n‭ supply issues.‬\n‭ As a result, the reportedly “[soaring] appetite for seafood” incentivizes fishing companies‬\n‭ to fish as much as possible, as frequently as possible. Combined with a need to compete for‬\n‭ limited fish, the negative externality that results from this business strategy is that overfishing‬\n‭ causes additional harm to the fish populations and can have lasting effects on how fish can‬\n‭ reproduce and be sustainable. As a result, the equilibrium level in the fish market actually causes‬\n‭ additional problems for the market, meaning the market will slowly fail as fish populations‬\n‭ become unable to survive overfishing and die out. This is also why so much of the article‬\n‭ covered the increasing need for cooperation and greater sustainability, as it is more efficient for‬\n‭ the market to have slightly lower supply if it also is able to exist permanently. While costs may‬\n‭ be slightly higher in the short term for producers and consumers (referred to as deadweight loss),‬\n‭ total surplus is higher because the common resource will have the ability to persist and allow the‬\n‭ market to persist as well.‬\n‭ I hope this clears things up!‬\n‭ Best,‬\n‭ Alexander‬\n‭ Works Cited‬\n‭ Mariani, J.

This week‬\n‭ in Econ 101, we learned about the concept of market failure and externalities. In this email, I‬\n‭ have included a real-world example from the‬‭ New York Times‬‭ to better illustrate these concepts‬\n‭ and hopefully better your understanding.‬\n‭ Market failure occurs as a result of inefficiency in a market absent any government‬\n‭ intervention. This often happens when there are factors that contribute to making the market‬\n‭ inefficient such as externalities. An externality can be positive or negative in nature. Positive‬\n‭ externalities are benefits gained by an individual or firm that they did not pay for, hence causing‬\n‭ the market to have a social marginal benefit. Negative externalities occur when an‬\n‭ uncompensated cost is imposed on an individual or firm and cause there to be a social marginal‬\n‭ cost.‬\n‭ The article I selected exhibits market failure due to a negative externality in the market‬\n‭ for plastic. It is written about “Plastic People,” a documentary that delves into the effects of‬\n‭ microplastics on human health. The article explains how a team of researchers discovered that‬\n‭ microplastics are able to cling to the walls of blood vessels and lead to a variety of health issues‬\n‭ including heart attacks, strokes, and even death (Jacobs). It also shares that microplastics in the‬\n‭ bloodstream can contribute to the growth of tumors in the brain. Another important thing to keep‬\n‭ in mind is the lack of government intervention when it comes to the market for plastics‬\n‭ highlighted in the article.‬\n‭ 2‬\n‭ These conditions create an example of market failure. The microplastics from pollution‬\n‭ that cause harm to human health are a negative externality. This is because the individuals facing‬\n‭ medical issues as a result of microplastics are not responsible for the production and resulting‬\n‭ pollution of the plastic. Therefore, there is a social marginal cost imposed upon those facing the‬\n‭ repercussions of microplastics. Additionally, the producers of plastics do not have to pay for the‬\n‭ harm they have caused.‬\n‭ This can be considered a market failure because the social marginal cost that exists due to‬\n‭ the externality creates deadweight loss and total external cost. This means that the market is not‬\n‭ operating at an efficient outcome. Furthermore, the addition of deadweight loss reduces the total‬\n‭ surplus. Total external cost exists between the marginal cost and social marginal cost. Thus, the‬\n‭ harm caused to human health as a result of microplastics is a negative externality that has led to‬\n‭ market failure.‬\n‭ I hope this explanation and example make the content from class this week more clear!‬\n‭ See you soon,‬\n‭ Your Classmate‬\n‭ Word Count: 441‬\n‭ Jacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.”‬‭ The New York Times‬‭ ,‬\n‭ The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024,‬\n‭ www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html‬",

      "essay": "Hello Friend, \nIn response to your question on market failure, Market failure is when “without any intervention, the market by itself does not reach the efficient outcome of total surplus by not fully accounting for the costs and benefits in the decisions it makes” (Dudley). Addressing market failures is crucial for getting towards market efficiency, which will reduce the waste of scarce resources. A recent real-life event that demonstrates market failure is the potential oil spill off the coast of Huntington Beach, California. This type of Market Failure in economics is defined as a negative externality, which is an external cost that affects third parties not directly involved in the market, where the environmental costs of oil production and consumption such as environmental pollution from the oil spill to the marine life, coastal ecosystems, and local economies are not fully reflected in the market. The failure of the market to internalize these external costs of environmental damage leads to inefficient resource allocation as consumers may not fully consider the environmental impact of their oil consumption such as oil extraction and transportation. Not to mention, since oil producers do not bear the full cost of production activities, such as pollution cleanup, the market incentivizes them to care less about allocating funds to prevent pollution. As a result, there is a misallocation of resources, distorting both production and consumption decisions in the market by incentivizing behaviors that harm the environment and efficient outcomes for society. Inefficiencies means that the total surplus is not maximized, and as the negative externality is reflected on the market, it is simply added onto the supply line, or the marginal costs, as an external cost. The total surplus at market equilibrium then because the sum of the total surplus and the negative total surplus subtracted. The total surplus with the external cost is less than the total cost at market equilibrium which means the market is currently inefficient since total efficiency is not maximized. The Oil Spill in California example presents the importance of recognizing and addressing market failures in our society that are happening right now. Addressing this misallocation often requires government interventions through regulations and taxes to internalize external costs and ensure that producers and consumers bear the true costs of their actions. By understanding the causes of market failures and implementing appropriate policy responses, the market can become efficient and making the most out of its limited resource by maximizing the total surplus. \n Word Count: 407\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Government Controls.” ECON 101: Principles of Economics I, Accessed \n3/11/2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\nFadulu, L.

      "essay": "Hey Friend,\nI hope you're doing okay amidst everything going on. I received your email about market\nfailure, and I'm here to help you better understand it.\nMarket failure is when production or consumption of a good by the free market takes\nplace at a level that is not socially optimal. Essentially, either too much or too little of the good\nwill be produced by the free market. There are several reasons why market failure happens, but\none of the most common causes is the presence of externalities.\nExternalities are costs or benefits that affect parties who are not directly involved in a\nmarket transaction. There are two types of externalities: positive and negative. Positive\nexternalities occur when third parties experience the benefits of a transaction, while negative\nexternalities occur when third parties experience the costs. Negative externalities, in particular,\nare a significant contributor to market failure. I found a recent article from The Wall Street\nJournal demonstrating this concept. Here is the link:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/global-co2-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2023-iea-says-ea522461?\nmod=economy_feat4_global_pos2\nIn this example, the market experiencing market failure is the market for fossil fuels and\nenergy. The article I provided discusses how global CO2 emissions hit a record high in 2023,\naccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This concerning trend underscores the\nfailure of this market to account for the negative externalities associated with carbon emissions.\nBurning these fossil fuels generates pollution which contributes to climate change. The cost of\npollution is both damaging to the environment and to our health. The producers and consumers\nof the fossil fuels, however, do not bear the costs of these emissions, the environment does. This\nfailure to internalize the external costs of carbon emissions leads to inefficient resource\nallocation and exacerbates climate change, highlighting a clear example of market failure in the\nenergy sector.\nIn essence, the market for fossil fuels fails to recognize the external costs of CO2\nemissions, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources and the intensification of climate\nchange. This example vividly demonstrates how market failure occurs when markets do not\nconsider the broader social and environmental impacts of their activities\nI hope this example clarifies the concept of market failure for you.

      "essay": "Recipient: My Friend\nSubject: Market Failure\nHello, sending my best regards to your family. Here’s an update to help you understand Market Failure while you’re away, I hope it helps.\nIn class, we learned that a market failure occurs when the economy, without government intervention, fails to reach an efficient outcome even when in equilibrium. In other words, the market simply cannot maximize total surplus. To visualize, let’s refer to a graph like we often do in class. We can determine the market failure by identifying the total surplus at market equilibrium, identifying the efficient outcome (maximum total surplus, or society’s net gain), then measuring the difference between the two. Market failure can be caused because of a negative externality, which is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. This causes an external cost, which can be seen through an additional leftward supply curve behind the original supply line on a graph, labeled “social marginal cost.” This represents the overall consequences of the negative externality on society; it forces a tax to be placed on the source that is negatively impacting the economy indirectly. This causes the price of the source to shoot upwards, hence the redrawn leftward social marginal cost curve which correlates to a higher price than the original supply curve. As we’ve learned, this tax on the negative external source is called a Pigouvian tax, which is necessary to stabilize its negative effect on the world, discourage its production, an inspire manufacturers who produce harmful emissions to look elsewhere for cleaner production techniques. One article written by Lydia DePillis, “We’re All Climate Economists Now,” pinpoints the significant negative externality of carbon emissions released from production factories, which contributes to market failure. The author stresses how global warming and carbon emissions negatively impact the economy by slowing down the gross domestic product (GDP). This has an overall detrimental effect on the economy because as the GDP is lowered due to climate change which is caused by excess carbon emissions released into the air, taxes must be put on those carbon emissions to discourage their production. Thich proves that market failure is inevitable, as total surplus cannot be maximized with a Pigouvian tax placed on the negative externality. To clarify, carbon emissions are classified as a negative externality that can cause market failure because air pollution is an unaffiliated subject that directly impacts the market. Overall, market failure can be summarized as when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, making a maximized total surplus unreachable. Negative externalities such as carbon emissions released from factory production contribute to this market failure, by increasing the social marginal cost as a result of climate change, which once again creates the need for a tax on the carbon emissions due to their overall negative environmental effect which directly impacts the economy.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failures occur when the market equilibrium outcome is not actually the efficient\noutcome as a result of externalities within the market that have either negative or positive effects\non individuals uninvolved in the market. An externality is an effect caused by the production or\nconsumption of a good or service that impacts parties unrelated to the market. Externalities are\nmeasured as a social marginal cost or a social marginal benefit, the social marginal cost is\nsubtracted from the supply curve by the measure of the externality cost for the production of one\nunit, and the social marginal benefit is added to the demand curve by the measure of the benefit\nof the consumption of one unit of the good.\nMarket failures are often present with pollution, the production of goods and services in\nmany industries creates pollution that is not measured within the market, thus exemplifying a\nmarket at equilibrium but not efficient. Pollution is a negative externality and to account for it\nwithin the market the social marginal cost of the production of one unit must be identified and\nsubtracted from the supply curve, which would lead to an efficient market outcome that would\nlikely lower production and increase price to mitigate the externality.\nHowever, market failures are not always negative, externalities from a market may\nproduce a positive effect on the uninvolved population. A good example of this is vaccinations,\nvaccinations positively affect the population by decreasing the likelihood of a disease spreading\nwith every vaccination. This presents a social marginal benefit, even if not everyone is\nvaccinated the more people there are the less likely a disease will spread.\nThe electric car industry also presents a positive market failure, the increased competition\nbetween electric car industries has created the positive externality of boosting the production of\nsustainable energy vehicles rather than gas and diesel vehicles which produce much greater\nenvironmental harm due to emission pollution. As competition to produce the most innovative,\nsustainable, and accessible electric vehicles rises between automotive companies like Tesla,\nBMW, General Motors, and more, supply becomes more accessible and demand rises due to the\nincrease in accessibility and decreased prices resulting from the competition (Ewing, 2024).\nIndividuals who own gasoline cars or who may not even own a car are both benefitting from the\ndecrease in vehicles that produce pollution. This presents a social marginal benefit to the whole\nof society where the consumption and production of electric cars are growing.\nMarket failures are present in almost every market, but unlike the word suggests they are\nnot always negative. Market failures can be adjusted into market efficiency when the social\nmarginal benefit or cost can be measured according to the production or consumption of a good\nor service, this measure will either be added to the the demand curve or subtracted from the\nsupply curve to locate the efficient outcome for the quantity and price.\nFrom,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 483\nReference\nEwing, J.

      "essay": "Econ 101 Dudley\nGood Afternoon Friend,\n\tAs you asked me to catch you up on the most recent Econ 101 topic “Market Failure”, I will provide you with plenty of information about market failure for you to be caught up. To cut to the chase, market failure can be explained in a couple of ways such as; Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. I can explain market failure in externalities the easiest way from the positive and negative externalities. \nWhen there are  negative externalities that means when a firm or an individual tries to force an uncompensated cost on others. It’s also known as the External Cost. Positive externalities is when a firm or individual benefits from providing to others while not receiving compensation. External benefit is also known for a positive externality.  A good way to look at it for both is for the negative think pollution and overgrown front yards. For the positive think vaccinations and nice front yards. I will link a reading down below from “The Wall Street Journal '' and it will give you an example of what market failure is. This is a good example because it goes under the negative externalities of market failure. Carbon emissions are a very big problem in the U.S and this is the cause of climate change which is a negative to society. Carbon emissions is a good example of a market failure because a business is not able to account for the cost of their emissions. \nTo see if this is a positive externality or negative externality is how many units it has. So if there are too many units of good compared to the efficient level then it's a negative externality. For a positive externality it is when there are too few units of a good compared to the efficient level. So on a graph you will have your equilibrium and to find the efficiency with a negative externality you have to take the producer marginal cost and add it to the external marginal cost. Since there is no positive externality then demand is the Social Marginal Benefit. Once you have your numbers the efficacy will be where Social Marginal Benefit intersects with the Social Marginal Cost. Then when finding a positive externality on a graph is similar to the negative externalities equation. The Social Marginal Benefit is what you are finding. To find that you will take the sum of Consumer Marginal Benefit and the External Marginal Benefit.\nThe article I gave to you is a negative externality because climate change is from burning poor emissions and those emissions do not last long. Market Failure is present in this situation because the polluters or businesses don’t have to pay for their pollution and emissions. It impacts society negatively. I hope this explanation of market failure and my article helps you get caught up in your missed lectures.  \nWord Count: 482\nWorks Cited\nGiulia Petroni.

I understand how tough this situation may be for you and am here to help clean up\nany confusion.\nMarket failure as a whole is exactly how it sounds, it is when something goes wrong in\nthe free market. This occurs when the market equilibrium is not efficient due to structural\nfailures in the market. These structural failures include externalities, market power and non\nprivate goods. An externality is a cost or benefit that is caused by one party but financially\nincurred or received by another. Depending on context, externalities can be negative or positive,\nleading to the indirect portion of a cost by one party onto another or a benefit spillover.\nExternalities impact markets by influencing this said allocation of resources, prices, and overall\nefficiency. In addition to externalities, market power is another example of a structural failure.\nMarket power is the ability each company possesses to control a price of a product or service in\nrelation to the level of competition in its industry and its control of supply and demand.\nEssentially, market power is how much a company can raise prices above the equilibrium price\naffecting all consumers and producers then leading to a discrepancy within the market. Lastly, a\nnon private good is a good that can be consumed by many people without the restriction of its\navailability to others. The private market has no incentive to provide such goods, therefore\ncreating market failure.\nMarket failure due to these three structural factors is actually quite common. In our\nmarket there are many outside factors that affect the market leading to market failure. For\ninstance, the New Y ork Times focuses on an externality leading to a positive twist on market\nfailure due to the measles outbreak in Britain this March 2024. The New Y ork Times article\nhighlights a vaccine used for this outbreak, an example of a positive externality. The benefits of a\nvaccination extend beyond the individual that directly receives the vaccine and are not fully\ncaptured by the vaccinated individual and or provider. These positive externalities justify public\nhealth interventions such as vaccination campaigns, subsidies for vaccines and government\nfunded immunization programs aimed at maximizing the societal benefits of vaccination. Megan\nSpecia, highlights this externality focusing on this outbreak of measles. Specia describes,\nchildren receiving measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are directly protected from these\ndiseases. The positive externality arises because their vaccination helps the community’s\nimmunity, reducing the spread of these contagious diseases. Specia explains that the low\nvaccination rate directly correlates to the outbreak in measles, therefore establishing the benefit\nto individuals and communities that receive said vaccination. When vaccination rates drop below\na certain threshold, the risk for outbreak arises, therefore vaccination is a positive externality for\nmarket failure.\nI hope this helps clear up your confusion. I hope to see you in class again soon,\nY our classmate\nWord Count: 493",

      "essay": "Hi,\nMarket failure is defined as when a market fails to be efficient on its own. Types of market\nfailures include externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. An\nexternality is when some entity that is otherwise unaffiliated with a market is affected by that\nmarket. There are two types of externalities, positive externalities (external benefits) and\nnegative externalities (external costs). A negative externality is an uncompensated cost an\nindividual or firm imposes on others.\nRecently, a Biomedical Research firm moved to Brazoria County, Texas, to research monkeys\nand they built a 900-acre monkey farm housing about 43,200 monkeys. Texans who bought their\nland in this county were not happy and said they are being disturbed by noise, the threat of\ndiseases spreading from the testing facility, and property devaluation. These effects of the\nmonkey farm do not negatively affect the biomedical research firm but instead are imposed on\nthe neighbors and residents in Brazoria County. This is a negative externality because the entity\n(the residents of Brazoria County), are being negatively affected by a market that they are\notherwise unaffiliated with (the Biomedical Research market). The market failure in this\nsituation is that the decision of the firm to house 43,200 monkeys in a residential area does not\nnegatively affect the firm but instead negatively affects the neighbors.\nSince this is a negative externality, we can measure it using supply (producer marginal cost),\ndemand (consumer marginal benefit and social marginal benefit), and social marginal cost (the\nsupply curve plus external marginal cost) which looks a leftward-shifted supply curve. This\nsupply/demand curve will have a market equilibrium where the supply and demand curves\nintersect but this market is not efficient. The efficient market equilibrium is where the social\nmarginal benefit intersects the social marginal cost. This situation creates negative total surplus\nwhich is also the deadweight loss at the market equilibrium.\nTo internalize this negative externality and move to the efficient market equilibrium you can\neither focus on the externality or the market for the good or service. If you focus on the\nexternality, you have three options: environmental standards, noise pollution taxes, and to create\ntradable permits. If you focus on the market, you also have three options: environmental\nstandards, taxes on the good or service (Pigouvian taxes on medicine developed by the firm), and\nproduction quotas. Since it is almost impossible to focus on the externality when dealing with\npollution (noise pollution created by the monkeys) because you cannot perfectly measure it and it\ncan be very expensive, we should focus on the market. In this market, we should put Pigouvian\ntaxes on the medicine developed by the firm and the tax should be equal to the external marginal\ncost. This tax will move the producer’s marginal cost leftward to the social marginal cost,\ncreating market efficiency.\n(470 Words)\nWork Cited\nSubbaraman, Nidhi. “How One Texas County Is Fighting 43,000 Monkeys.” The Wall Street\nJournal, 2024. wsj, https://www.wsj.com/science/environment/how-one-texas-county-is-\nfighting-43-000-monkeys-283fa869?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink.

      "essay": "Market failure is when a market fails to reach efficiency on its own. This means that the\nmarket fails to independently maximize total surplus. When discussing market failure, there are\nthree parties to consider: the producer, the consumer, and a third party affected by the production\nor consumption of the goods or services in the market. When taking all three parties into\nconsideration, the efficient outcome of the market is the intersection of social marginal cost and\nsocial marginal benefit. This is simply either the producer’s marginal cost plus total external cost\nor the consumer’s marginal benefit plus total external benefit.\nOne cause of market failure is artificially scarce goods which are goods and services that\nare excludable but non-rival. This means that the producer of the good or service can prevent\nthose who don’t pay for the good or service from using it but multiple people can use the same\ngood or service at the same time. This also means that allowing one additional person to use the\ngood or service does not cost the producer anything. Therefore, the social marginal cost for the\nproducer is nothing and because the efficient outcome is the intersection of social marginal cost\nand social marginal benefit, the market is most efficient when the producer charges nothing for\nthe good or service. Total surplus is maximized when the producer charges nothing for an\nartificially scarce good because it costs them nothing to allow another consumer to use their\ngood or service and then each consumer’s entire willingness to pay becomes surplus.\nRecently, Disney+ announced plans to crackdown on password sharing. This could force\nmillions of users who rely on password sharing, an illegal activity, to either create subscriptions\nof their own or to not watch the content on the platform. This is a great example of an artificially\nscarce good. Disney+ is a platform that is excludable, meaning you must pay for the service to\naccess it, but it is also non-rival, as millions of consumers are able to use it and watch the same\nshows and movies at the same time. In the streaming market, the efficient price would be $0\nbecause, in this example, it costs Disney nothing to let one more person use their streaming\nservice. So why don’t they? Because it is not sustainable for the business. While allowing\nanother consumer to access the service costs the company nothing, licensing content, creating\ncontent, and marketing content does cost a lot. If Disney+ cost $0, total surplus would be\nmaximized but the business would likely go out of business because they would not be\ngenerating any profit. It is still however considered market failure because independently, the\nmarket is not maximizing total surplus and the price for the platform is not at the efficient level.\nWord Count: 465\nWorks Cited\nSchmall, Emily. “To Boost Profits, Disney Cracks down on Password Sharing.” The New\nYork Times, 1 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/business/hulu-password-sharing-disney-plus.html?\nsearchResultPosition=3.

      "essay": "Lecturer Dudley\nEcon 101\n499 words\nDear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well amidst your family emergency. I understand that you’re seeking\nclarity on the concept of market failure.\nMarket failure occurs when, absent any intervention, the market fails to reach the efficient\noutcome, even in equilibrium. Market failure can occur due to various factors such as externalities,\ncommon resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. I’ll be using an example of a negative\nexternality to help develop your understanding of market failure.\nA negative externality, also known as an external cost, is a cost that an individual or firm imposes\non some third party without compensating this third party. One example of a negative externality is\npollution–as a firm emits pollution, an individual miles away can incur the external costs through various\nmeans such as changes in weather patterns or contaminated drinking water.\nUnderstanding market failure is crucial for analyzing the limitations of free markets and\ndesigning effective economic policies to bring markets towards efficiency. I hope to aid you in\nunderstanding market failure through an article I found which clearly exemplifies negative externalities.\nThe linked article discusses the proposed development of 60 subsidized affordable housing\napartments in an affluent area of Florence, South Carolina. Residents of the county have been determined\nto resist the development of these affordable housing apartments due to the external costs that would be\nimposed on them as a result of their development. Particularly, residents have pointed to traffic congestion\nand flooding on county roads.\n“Adding apartments near one of the city’s busiest intersections would leave\nmore drivers cutting through streets where their children play.\n” Regarding flooding, critics of the\nproposed development plan claimed that “paving the six-acre wooded site would worsen runoff”\n(DeParle, 2024).\nBoth of these concerns serve as great example of negative externalities in action. If the affordable\nhousing apartments were to be developed, current residents of the county will be burdened with the\nexternal costs of traffic congestion and flooding which put their property and children’s safety at risk.\nWith the developers not compensating the residents for these costs, residents have rallied together in\nopposition of the proposed development.\nThese negative externalities clearly exemplify market failure. If developers build the affordable\nhousing units, then a negative external cost results in the market. This cost being uninternalized results in\nthe market overproducing the good (affordable housing), as the market doesn’t take into account the\nexternal costs imposed on previous residents. This concept can be further understood through an analysis\nof market efficiency. A market is efficient when total surplus is maximized, which occurs when marginal\ncost equal marginal benefit. However, with an external cost in the market, social marginal cost is greater\nthan independent marginal cost. An efficient market would therefore produce at the quantity where social\nmarginal cost intersects demand. In the case of a negative externality, this is always a lower quantity than\nin equilibrium, and so the market overproduces in equilibrium.\nI hope this helps you better understand market failure. Best wishes to your family.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nReferences\nDeParle, J. (2024, March 1). Developers Got Backing for Affordable Housing. Then the Neighborhood\nFound Out.

      "essay": "To My Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well.\nIn class today, we started a new topic that focuses on the concept of market failure. We explored\nboth goods classified as private and those that aren’t, finding examples of market failure in each.\nI have recently come across an article that highlights a form of market failure discussed in class,\nand feel inclined to share it with you to guide your understanding of this chapter. Before\nbeginning our discussion of this article, it is important to first establish your understanding of\nwhat market failure is.\nMarket failure, as defined by the Corporate Finance Institute, is “the inefficient distribution of\ngoods and services in the free market.” In other words, market failure is when a market does not\nreach its maximum total surplus, and deadweight loss is created. Market failure arises in the\nabsence of intervention, governmental or otherwise, and it fails to achieve an efficient outcome\neven when it is in equilibrium. In class, we focused on four main types of failure:\n1) Private Goods - Negative and positive externalities\n2) Common Resources\n3) Artificially Scarce Goods\n4) Public Goods\nNow that the definitions and concepts for market failure have been addressed, we can look at the\narticle and the type of market failure it discusses. The article that I have found is from the Wall\nStreet Journal titled “Biotech VCs See Room for More Growth in Obesity Drug Market,”\n(Gormely, B.) The article goes in-depth about the potential of developing a new drug to aid\nweight loss, even though the initial drug is used by individuals suffering from diabetes. It is an\nexample of market failure and more specifically, artificially scarce goods. Artificially scarce\ngoods are considered a public good. It is non-excludable, meaning the user does not have to pay\na price, and rival, meaning only one user can use it per unit. The rivalry leads to a social impact\nbecause of the consumer's actions leading to social marginal cost. The impact of diabetics having\nto compete for a drug essential for them to live.\nArtificially scarce goods identify how the cost of this new drug is significantly more than the\ncost of producing each unit. However, it becomes artificially scarce because the social marginal\ncost produced from the good leads to the efficient quantity of consumption becoming lower than\nthe market quantity. This results in a significant amount of deadweight loss, the reaming\nresources.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI understand that you have been struggling with the concept of market failure in our\nECON-101 class, so hopefully this email can help you understand the concept a little better.\nThe definition of market failure is an inefficient allocation of goods and services in a free\nmarket. In other words, this is when a market’s demand (by consumers) does not equal the\namount supplied. This occurs when an individual person or firm does what is best for\nthemselves, but not optimal (equilibrium) for the market. Other terms in economics that are\nclassified as market failures are externalities, common resources, public goods, artificially scarce\ngoods .\nTo illustrate an example of a market failure, I am providing a link at the bottom of this\nemail to a US News and World Report article of a real world market failure. The article, from\nMarch of this year, goes into detail about how BP (the oil and gas giant) reported an increase in\ncarbon emissions for the first time since 2019. Pollution is arguably the most well known\nreal-world market failure, and this article is a perfect example of this type of scenario.\nGoing back to earlier, I listed different types of market failures: those being externalities,\ncommon resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. In the BP carbon emissions story,\nthe type of failure being explored is an externality, specifically a negative externality. An\nexternality is an unintended side effect of an action that is not reflected in the cost of the action,\nand is paid for primarily not by the people involved in the actual activity (so the cost is taken on\nby the general public). Externalities can be both positive and negative, depending on the side\neffect, and in this scenario, the pollution from BP is a negative externality.\nTo understand how this article defines a negative externality, we need to break it down.\nBP’s actions to release the amount of carbon emissions that they do, even though it is detrimental\nto the environment, is a perfect example of a market failure - a corporation doing what is best for\nthemselves, but not the global population. It is a negative externality because the unintended\nconsequence (pollution) affects the people breathing in the air (global population) and climate\nchange, instead of BP itself. Thus, BP’s carbon footprint is both a market failure and negative\nexternality.\nHopefully, this email helps you understand the concept of market failure better.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nA market failure, in short, is a cause of a market not being as efficient as it can be. This\ncould be in the form of a shortage of goods or a shortage or demand for a product that makes the\nmarket for a certain product inefficient. There are 4 types of market failures: Externalities,\ncommon resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. Each of these market failures is\ncaused by different factors but ultimately has the same effect on the market. All of these types of\nmarket failures shift the market for a product not to be as efficient as possible. To better\nunderstand this, I have an example of what a market failure looks like in today’s world.\nIn the Wall Street Journal article, New Regulation Aims to Rein In Soot Pollution, the\neffects of the law to limit particle pollution are discussed. In this case, we will be looking at a\nnegative externality, which is defined as something that impacts a person or market without\nbeing involved in it. In this article, they go in-depth about how the market will be affected by this\nnew law being put in place, limiting the number of pollution particles a certain factory can emit.\nAs seen in the article, the cap on pollution emissions will hurt factories, power plants, trucks, and\nmore. For example, “In 1990, coal produced more than half of the nation's supply of electricity.\nThat has dropped to less than 20% today, according to the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration” (Niiler). In this case, the market failure is taking the form of a negative\nexternality. The negative externality in this case is the limit on pollution. The pollution limit is a\nnegative externality because it is uninvolved with the coal market, yet it has a major effect on\ntheir production. This new pollution limit will lower the amount of electricity a coal factory can\nproduce, therefore shifting the supply and demand curve left, resulting in deadweight loss.\nThis pollution limit will make all markets affected, and in this particular example the coal\nindustry, inefficient in their respective markets. In the coal industry, the pollution limit will result\nin deadweight loss, limiting the supply of energy given by the coal. This will make all coal\nfactories less efficient than they would be with no pollution limit. The market failure can be\nidentified as the pollution limit because it affects a certain market to make it inefficient.\nNiiler, E., & Hiller, J. (2024, Feb 09).

      "essay": "Subject: Understanding Market Failure Through Recent Research on Air Pollution\n\nDear Adrian,\n\nI hope you're holding up okay and that your family situation is manageable. I just wanted to help clarify the concept of market failure for you, especially since I know you want to keep up with our econ coursework while you’re away.\n\nMarket failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often leading to negative outcomes that the market does not correct on its own. There are several types of market failures, including externalities, public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods. In this quick email, I’ll focus on externalities and public goods, since they are directly relevant to an article I came across recently.\n\nIn an article published by The New York Times, researchers have discovered that air pollution not only has direct health impacts on humans but also significantly affects the natural pollination process. Specifically, the study found that nitrate radicals present in urban air pollution degrade the scent of flowers, making them less attractive to pollinating insects such as the hawk moth. This reduction in pollination could have dire consequences for plant reproduction, the food chain.\n\nThis situation represents a negative externality, where the costs of pollution are not caused by the producers or consumers of those pollutants but by the environment and society at large. The deterioration of ecosystem services, such as pollination, which is essential for the production of many fruits and vegetables, represents a failure of the market to account for these external costs.\n\nMoreover, the ecosystem services affected by this pollution can be considered public goods. They are non-excludable and non-rival, meaning no one can be effectively excluded from using them, and one person's use does not reduce availability to others. The market fails to provide these goods at the optimal level because there's no direct profitability in maintaining them. This leads to underinvestment in their preservation and overinvestment in activities that harm them.\n\nThis article underscores the profound and far-reaching impacts of air pollution. It highlights the necessity for regular intervention to correct market failures by internalizing external costs, through pollution taxes or regulations that limit emissions to preserve public goods like ecosystem health.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of market failure for you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further examples.

      "essay": "Hi, Michael, \nI hope you’re managing well with everything that’s going on. I understand you're looking for clarity on the concept of market failure. The New York Times article written by Lydia DePillis called “We’re All Climate Economists Now” presents an excellent example of what market failure really represents through climate change as a global issue. \nDePillis’ article investigates how market failure manifests itself in terms of climate economics where the real prices of goods and services do not incorporate actual cost associated with carbon emissions (externalities). This article discusses a recently held economic conference at which climate change was discussed from various angles such as its repercussions on flooding driven real estate values or reliability of energy grids during extreme weather. \nNegative externalities are the essence of these examples where business and consumption go beyond the immediate seller and buyer to third parties as well as the environment without compensation or cost accounting. It also touches on common resources and public goods, expressing how climate change exploits our atmosphere that’s non-excludable. Anybody can use this but nobody is actually answerable for its decay. This is referred to as tragedy of the commons—a situation whereby individual users make separate decisions guided by their selfish interests in consuming communal resources even if it is not good for anyone in the long run. \nIn addition, it refers to artificially scarce goods like permits in a cap-and-trade system for emissions, suggesting them as possible ways of addressing such market failures. This idea involves establishing an emission market that encourages firms to create and minimize their carbon footprints, thus internalizing pollution externality. But that’s not all about knowing a problem alone. DePillis draws attention to how economic thinking has shifted over time among economists’ community. Economists seek actively to shape policy with an aim of influencing government decisions towards sustainability based on economic incentives.\nOn the other hand, if solar power was subsidized, it could make them more popular and thus correct market failure through technological innovation. The failures of markets are crucial because they need governments to intervene in such situations. That would be through taxation, legislation or grants. These kinds of interventions are critical in guiding an economy towards a future that is both sustainable and fairer, where climate change costs do not penalize the poor so much. I trust this summary has helped you understand what market failure means in terms of actual problems like global warming. \nI have attached the article below for your further explorations on this topic.

      "essay": "Dear my friend,\nI’ve heard that you find it confusing when trying to understand the new concept\n“market failure” taught in Econ 101. Thus, I’m writing this mail to help you understand\nthis concept with a news article which may be useful to explain it.\nTo begin with, let me briefly introduce the definition of market failure. The word\ndescribes a situation which often occurs when the allocation of goods by a free market\nis not efficient enough, leading to a deadweight loss of the society net gain. Market\nfailures can be caused by several factors, including Externalities, Common Resources,\nPublic Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods.\nOne recent example of market failure is included in a news article from The New\nYork Times, titled “E.P.A. Sets Limits on Carcinogenic Gas Used to Sterilize Medical\nDevices” (Friedman, 2024). The article discusses the EPA’s new regulations on the use\nof ethylene oxide, a gas used to sterilize medical devices. Though this gas is essential\nfor medical purpose, its use has caused a lot of health issues in communities\nsurrounding sterilization facilities.\nThe market failure that occurs here is related to negative externalities. Externality\nrefers to a cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially received by that\nproducer. In the case of ethylene oxide, the companies using this gas did not need to be\nresponsible for the full costs of its emission. Instead, the surrounding communities\nsuffered from increased cancer risks due to air pollution. Therefore, we can regard the\nethylene oxide as a kind of negative externality. The external cost of its emissions is not\nreflected in the market price of medical device sterilization, resulting in overuse of\nethylene oxide and higher future cost of curing cancer. It means that the current\nequilibrium of this free market cannot reach to a maximum net gain, and will lead to a\ndeadweight loss due to its potential future cost.\nIn addition, we can also view this market failure considering the role of common\nresources. Clean air can be considered a non-rival and non-excludable common\nresource, which means that it’s available for everyone to use, and one person’s use\ndoesn’t diminish another’s. However, when these companies emit pollutants like\nethylene oxide, they make clean air rival. They consume the quality of this common\nresource freely, transferring the cost to those who have to compete for using clean air\nresource, finally leading to a market failure.\nThe EPA’s intervention to limit the use of ethylene oxide is an attempt to correct\nthis market failure. By imposing stricter regulations, the EPA attempt to internalize the\nnegative externality, making the companies responsible for the impact of their actions.\nIt is crucial because the free market failed to cover the health costs imposed on the\npublic, which should have been included in the cost of production.\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the market failure better. If you have\nany questions, feel free to ask me.\nSincerely,\nYour friend\nWord Count: 495\nWorks Cited\nFriedman, L. (2024, March 14). E.P.A.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nPublic goods are omnipresent in our lives, and sometimes, they result in market failures.\nMarket failure comes in the form of public goods, arti_x0000_cially scarce goods, common resources, and\nexternalities, and it occurs when individual incentives do not lead to the maximization of society\n’\ns total\nnet gain. In other words, the market, during market failure, does not naturally produce at the e_x0000_cient\nquantity, disallowing it to reach equilibrium. With such reduction of total surplus, deadweight loss\nsurfaces, an indication of potential market failure or current market failure.\nT oday, we\n’re focusing on externalities, speci_x0000_cally a negative externality. An externality is when\nthe production or consumption of a speci_x0000_c good or service produces an unintentional extra cost or\nbene_x0000_t for a third party, such as vaccines. In terms of looking at externalities on a graph, the social\nmarginal bene_x0000_t and price curves indicate the type of existing market failure and the extent to which it\nhas an impact on culture and society. For example, a positive externality occurs when the social bene_x0000_t\nis above the demand curve, giving the third party an unintentional positive bene_x0000_t. On the other hand,\na negative externality occurs when social cost exceeds supply. Thus, it’\ns an external cost that the market\nfails to account for and overproduces. A common example of a negative externality resides in\nsecondhand smoking. Danny Nguyen, in his article,\n“ Apartment dwellers plagued by secondhand\nsmoke have little recourse,\n”\nexplores secondhand smoking as a negative externality through recent\nexamples of a_x0000_ected tenants in D.C.:\n“Gil doesn’t smoke. And smoking isn’t allowed in [her apartment\nbuilding]. But smoke seeps in — through electrical sockets, air conditioning systems, crevices between\n_x0000_oorboards and gaps in insulation” (Nguyen 1). Individuals like Gil, who inhale tobacco smoke\nexhaled by smokers become unintentionally exposed to those chemicals; in other words, even if that\nindividual has never smoked before, they still face the consequences. Further, a signi_x0000_cant social cost is\nassociated with cigarette consumption and thus the market is unable to correct itself without\ngovernment intervention when too many units of the good are produced,\n“impair[ing] the health of\nthe building\n’\ns tenants\n” (Nguyen 1), and _x0000_tting under our de_x0000_nition for market failure as an ine_x0000_cient\ndistribution of goods.\nNon-smoking tenants such as Gil are asking,\n“‘how much more do I have to take?’” (Nguyen\n1). In order to improve this economically, promoting e_x0000_ciency and correcting secondhand smoking\n’\ns\nnegative externality requires the market to produce where SMC and SMB intersect, not just impacting\ncosts but also a_x0000_ecting total surplus. Thus, taxing the negative externality involved in secondhand\nsmoking is the most productive approach for correction as the market will move from market\nequilibrium to the e_x0000_cient price and quantity. Conceptually, this will discourage consumption and\nproduction of cigarettes, reducing the\n“\ngrave risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and cancer”\n(Nguyen 1).\nMarket failure is a confusing topic, but I hope the example of secondhand smoking, a negative\nexternality we\n’re exposed to in many of our daily lives, helps you gain understanding.\nBest,\nY our Friend\n(W ord count: 500)\nW orks Cited\nNguyen, D.

      "essay": "Dear My Friend,\nA market failure occurs when, absent any intervention including government\nintervention, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even when the market is in\nequilibrium. Failing to reach the efficient outcome occurs when the market does not maximize its\ntotal surplus.\nOne way in which a market failure can occur is due to externalities. An externality as an\nuncompensated effect that an individual or firm imposes on others. Essentially, a third party who\ndoes not act as a producer or consumer is inadvertently affected. There are negative externalities\nwhich harm this third party and positive externalities which benefit the third party. Positive\nexternalities occur when the third party benefits by the actions of the producer and consumer.\nThe market overproduces when there is negative externality and it underproduces when there is a\npositive externality.\nA real world example of a negative externality would be the wildfires in the Texas\nPanhandle that were caused by the company Xcel Energy’s power lines. A powerline explosion\nin the region caused an unprecedented fire in the state.The fire destroyed more than one million\nacres of land and killed tens of thousands of livestock (Xcel Energy). This is a negative\nexternality because Xcel Energy as producer supplies energy for their consumers who demand it,\nbut unfortunately the third party acting as ranchers in the Texas Panhandle have been negatively\naffected. Not only have the rancher’s land been destroyed, but many of their product, being the\ncows, have been killed.\nWhen there is a negative externality, there is a negative total surplus which can also be\nreferred to as deadweight loss. This deadweight loss acts as a representation of the cost that\nsociety must face due to market inefficiencies. A representation of this cost that society has faced\ndue to the fires is loss of land and cattle. In market equilibrium, by failing to account for an\nexternality, the maximum total surplus is not generated. Particularly, when there is a negative\nexternality such as in the case of the Texas Panhandle fires, the market equilibrium will result in\ntoo many units of the good compared to the efficient level. In this particular case, the good would\nbe the livestock, so there would be an increased amount of cattle than what the efficient level is\ndeemed to be.\nIn summation, the Texas Panhandle fires represent market failure because they act as a\nnegative externality. Land in the region and cattle were harmed by the fires and they act as a\nthird party to the Xcel Energy Company and their consumers.\nWord Count: 428\nWorks Cited\nU.S. Weather - Latest News and Research on Climate and Weather ...,\nwww.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/xcel-energy-review-shows-texas-wildf\nires-may-have-started-at-its-facilities-18784c69.

      "essay": "Whats up man,\nThanks for reaching out with your question. I hope everything is alright with your family.\nMarket failure can be confusing at first for sure but once you get an understanding of it,\nit's super easy. Market failure is when a market fails to reach the efficient outcome and does not\nmaximize total surplus even in equilibrium. This also is in absence of any intervention including\ngovernment intervention. This can be caused by externalities, Common Resources, Public\nGoods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. Some examples of negative externalities include pollution\n(which is the example I am going to give you), traffic, or taxation. Some examples of positive\nexternalities include reducing pollution, making an area more visually pleasing, and education.\nPrivate goods are the only type of goods that does not create a market failure because it is the\nonly type of good that the market can allocate efficiently. This is because the good is excludable\nand rival in consumption.\nQuick review:\nExcludable: price to get a good, need to pay\nRival in consumption: each individual unit of good is not available for other people\nCommon resources can lead to market failure because they are non excludable. People can take\nadvantage of this resource. Artificially scarce goods can lead to market failure because they are\nnonrival in consumption. Public goods can lead to market failure because they are not excludable\nand nonrival in consumption. When a good is non excludable or non rival, the market cannot\nvalue the goods and the market fails.\nOkay now onto an example of a market failure.\nhttps://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/united-states-lives-devastated-and-human-\nrights-sacrificed-by-toxic-fossil-fuel-related-pollution-from-petrochemical-plants-in-texas-a\nnd-louisiana/\nThis article is about the negative impacts on humanities caused by fossil fuel consumption from\npetrochemical plants. The pollution emitted by the petrochemical industry in areas like the\nHouston Ship Channel imposes significant costs on nearby communities in terms of health\nimpacts, reduced property values, and overall quality of life. This is a negative externality. This\nrepresents a market failure as it results in extreme negative externalities.

      "essay": "\nHello Friend!\n\tTo help you understand market failure I will define it in my own words and then use a recent article I discovered in the Washington Post to exemplify how market failure appears in real life. In simple terms, market failure is the imbalance in a market caused by either an advantage or disadvantage that can affect those in or out of the market. In equilibrium, the market supplies both consumers and producers with a balanced and equal market. For every good demanded there is a supply to fulfill that demand. However, many markets are not perfect, therefore, some factors alter the market and cause market failure. These factors most commonly are externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. In the article I will be using to explain a real-world example of market failure, the type of market failure that occurs is caused by a negative externality. In most cases, a negative externality is an effect of business that harms a third party outside of the market for said good. A popular example of this is pollution. \n\tIn the article “How air pollution prevents pollinators from finding their flowers”, Grandoni describes an experimental study in which they test how pollution affects pollinators. From experiments with nighttime pollinators white-line sphinx and tobacco hawk moth, the scientists discovered that the NO3, Nitrate, in the air, hinders nighttime pollinators' ability to detect flowers. This is classified as a negative externality because the scientists pinned down that the cause of the NO3 gasses in the area was due to the oil and car manufacturing businesses. The market failure occurs because on the graph of supply and demand the social marginal cost shifts to the left making it higher than the equilibrium supply. This reflects the higher social cost of producing the product as it also negatively affects the pollinators. Now the market will not be in equilibrium and the prices of goods will become higher as a result of the social cost of the good. The production of oil and cars becomes more socially expensive, therefore, the price for these goods begins to increase above the equilibrium price. Due to this shift in the supply curve the supply and demand line now has a dead weight loss of money that could’ve been received by the businesses, but instead is wasted because the market will not allow for the original quantity of gas or cars to be sold. Due to these reasons, market failure has occurred due to the oil and car production of pollution. \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/08/air-pollution-pollinator-moths/\nHope this helps,\nYour friend\n440\n\nGrandoni, Dino. “How Air Pollution Prevents Pollinators From Finding Their Flowers.” The Washington Post, 8 February 2024, \n",

      "essay": "To: Friend in Economics 101\nFrom: Friend in Economics 101\nDate: 26th March 2024\nSubject: Explanation on Market Failures\n\tGood afternoon!\nI am happy to provide some insight on market failures. Up to now, we have addressed market equilibrium as the efficient price and quantity of the supply and demand curves. However, certain unique events may occur in the market, that cause the market quantity and price to be different from the efficient quantity and price. Economists identify these cases as “market failures”, where a lack of government intervention causes the market to be unable to reach maximum total surplus (Dudley 5 March 2024). \n\tIn lecture, Professor Dudley covered six different market failures: negative externalities, positive externalities, private goods, artificially scarce goods, common resources, and public goods. Recently, I read an article from the New York Times titled Big Companies Cashed In on Mississippi’s Water. Small Towns Paid the Price. that is an excellent example of a market failure occurring because of a common resource. The article details how citizens from Jackson, Mississippi experienced inadequate access to water after dysfunctional water meters were installed by a German Company, Siemens. \nTo understand this market failure, you must understand common resources. Common resources are defined by two factors, excludability and rivalry in consumption. The term “excludable” means a supplier of a good or service can prevent people who have not paid for it from consuming it. The term “rival in consumption” means the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at one time (Dudley 12 March 2024). In the context of the water crisis in Mississippi, water is a common resource because it is non-excludable and a rival in consumption. This is because citizens cannot consume the same exact unit of water, but they are able to freely access it regardless of whether they paid for it. \nA primary issue resulting from non-excludable goods is the “Free Rider Problem”. Free riders are individuals who benefit from a good while not contributing to its upkeep. In the case of public waterworks, some citizens don’t contribute monetarily to the upkeep of water infrastructure. The actions of these free riders’ impact common resources, so there is a change in the supply and demand curve. The supply curve will present as the private marginal cost for the government to supply the water. The impact of free-riders and rivalry in consumption will create a social marginal cost curve above the private marginal cost curve that signifies the cost which Mississippians face. The intersection of private marginal cost and demand is the market equilibrium, and the intersection of social marginal cost and demand is the efficient level at which the market produces. This is where the market failure occurs because the efficient quantity is less than market quantity. So, there is an overconsumption of the common resource.\n Public water works are an important societal issue since they are consistently underfunded and mismanaged by companies like Siemens. I hope this example provided you with ample information on market failures, but please reach out with any questions. \nBests,\nYour friend in Economics 101\nWord Count: 500\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDudley, M.

      "essay": "Hello Friend!\nI got your email about confusions regarding market failure. I would be happy to explain.\nIn its most economically technical definition, market failure is when the market, without any external government intervention, fails to maximize total surplus on its own. Graphically, you can see this on the supply and demand curves when the point where the market is efficient is different than its equilibrium point. Market failures have a variety of causes, but they are most associated with externalities, or goods which are either non-excludable or non-rivals in consumption. \nI found an article (attached at the end of this email) which highlights a negative externality. To elaborate further, a negative externality is an unrealized cost that a firm imposes on a third party. Examples of negative externalities are pollution, extra traffic caused by road production, and secondhand smoke. \nIn the article, the journalist, Iven Penn of the New York Times, examines how constructed power lines have been causing mass wildfires across the United States. He explains how a fire caused by a downed utility pole destroyed roughly 300 homes (citation). With the ever-growing issue of climate change, other states are seeing similar issues with electrical infrastructure. Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis based electrical company admits that they were most likely responsible for the Smokehouse Creek Fire and even Hawaiian Electrical, a Hawaiian based electrical company, reported their powerlines caused a fire in Lahaina (citation).\nAs seen in the above examples, the creation of electrical infrastructure is a negative externality in the United States economy. In this case, the firms are the electrical companies responsible for setting up the electrical power lines and the affected third party are the citizens displaced by wildfires kick started from failing power lines. \nIn more technical economic terms, the supply (representing the producer’s marginal cost) increases due to the unconsidered external cost of damage done by wildfires. As a result, the efficient quantity of electrical infrastructure “units” should decrease and the price per unit should increase. However, because this is an unrealized cost, the market continues to operate at the previous equilibrium in price and quantity. Ultimately, the market’s total surplus is not maximized, and the market fails.\nNow, it is important to note that it isn’t entirely the electrical company’s fault. Climate change plays a huge role in magnification of powerline related wildfires. Additionally, even though the creation of powerlines may result in a negative externality for the ‘powerline’ market, electrical infrastructure is a massively important part of society; without it, quality of life would dramatically decrease, and economic progress would come to a halt. It is therefore important to realize that market failure isn’t inherently ‘bad’. It’s just about weighing the benefits and consequences of a dynamic economic system.\nHope this provides some insight!\nAiden\nWC: 464\nReferences\n\nPenn, Ivan. “Utility-Caused Wildfires Are Becoming a National Problem.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 22 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/business/energy-environment/electric-utilities-wildfires-climate-change.html. \n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Econ 101 Classmate,\nI received your email about confusion with the concept of market failure, and I am happy to help try and clear it up! The other day I was browsing the New York Times, and I discovered a really interesting article about a market failure in our economy. I'll link it here if you want to check it out: article.\nThe most basic way to think about market failure is a market failing to reach the efficient outcome. In other words, even when the market is in equilibrium, total surplus is not maximized. It should be noted, that this is absent any intervention (including intervention from the government), and simply the natural market. \nMarket failure can occur for a number of reasons, but the main one the article focused on is due to something called an externality. An externality is an “external” effect or impact that the market does not account for, which usually affects people who are not consumers or producers in that market. By impacting that third party of people, inefficiencies arise. With a positive externality, the market equilibrium results in too few units of the good compared to the efficient level because we are ignoring a benefit (Dudley). With a negative externality, the market equilibrium results in too many units of the good compared to the efficient level, as we are ignoring a cost (Dudley). These costs and benefits can be represented in our supply and demand diagrams as external marginal costs or external marginal benefits. By failing to account for the externality, the market equilibrium does not generate the maximum amount of total surplus, therefore the market fails to be socially efficient. \nMore specifically, the example I stumbled upon has to do with health risks in everyday foods that we consume! The author, Andrew Jacobs, explains the rising health threat that microplastics are beginning to pose. This is largely due to the value we give plastics due to its convenience it provides in production (especially when the majority goes unrecycled). Not only do non recycled plastics lead to polluting our environment, but small particles known as microplastics (plastics broken down into small particles by wind erosion, sea erosion, as well as sunlight) are finding their way into our food and posing a direct threat to our health (Jacobs). One place we are seeing extreme accumulation of these plastics are the oceans, which is concerning because it means that many of the seafood contains microplastics, which then enter our bodies when they are served on our plates.\nThis external cost individuals are facing is not accounted for in the market for plastic goods or the foods we are consuming, and therefore can be considered a negative externality. This is an excellent example of the market failing to reach the efficient outcome due to the fact that the total external cost will decrease the total surplus, meaning society’s total net gain is not maximized! In other words, the market is ignoring a detrimental cost: the health effects of microplastics in our foods!\n\nRegards,\nFellow Econ 101 Peer\n\nWord Count: 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell.

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI am writing this email to clarify your confusion about market failure using a real-world\nexample. Before defining market failure it is important to differentiate between market\nequilibrium and market efficiency. Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals\nquantity demanded in a market. This is different from market efficiency because market\nefficiency occurs when total surplus is maximized in the market. Knowing the difference\nbetween these terms, you can better understand when market failure occurs.\nMarket failure occurs when absent intervention, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome,\neven in equilibrium(Dudley). In order to reach an efficient outcome in a market, the market must\nmaximize total surplus without intervention. There can be many causes of market failure,\nincluding externalities, which are unconsidered costs, known as negative externalities, or\nbenefits, known as positive externalities, unconsidered by decision-makers in the market.\nExternalities that cause market failure can be seen in our everyday lives. As seen in the\narticle below, an example of market failure is taking place in production industries due to fine\nindustrial particle pollution output(Friedman). In this case, we can identify pollution as the\nnegative externality causing market failure. Particle pollution can be classified as a negative\nexternality because pollution is an external cost imposed on society that decision-makers do not\nconsider when choosing how much to produce. With this external cost, the market fails to reach\nefficiency because it does not combine external marginal costs with the consumer’s marginal\ncosts to produce. The combination of producer’s marginal cost and external marginal costs can\nbe known as social marginal cost.\nTo see where the market is efficient and is no longer failing, it is important to visualize\nthe impact of these externalities on a graph. At market equilibrium, where the externality is not\nconsidered, quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. However, when including external\nmarginal cost in the market, the supply curve shifts left to demonstrate the social marginal cost.\nWhen the supply curve shifts to the left, we see that the quantity where social marginal cost\nequals demand is less than the equilibrium quantity. With an equilibrium quantity greater than\nthe efficient quantity, we see overproduction because those in the market are not considering the\nexternal cost of pollution on society. Negative total surplus happens as a result of overproduction\nin the market and thus, limits total surplus from being maximized. As I explained earlier, if total\nsurplus is not maximized, the market is experiencing failure.\nTo pursue market efficiency, the government may intervene and use mechanisms such as\ntaxes, quotas, and tradable emissions permits to reduce negative externalities. In this example\nspecifically, the EPA is attempting to limit the pollution output through a quota of, “ nine\nmicrograms per cubic meter of air(Friedman).” However, we must question how well this quota\nwill work, as it can be difficult to measure the exact amount of pollution each producer creates.\nI hope this helps your understanding of market failure.\nSincerely, Y our Classmate\nWord Count:497\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. \"Externalities.\" Mar 5 2024, Economics 101, Department of\nEconomics, University of Michigan.

      "essay": "First draft\n\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure with California's Gasoline Car Ban\nTo: Alex\n\nDear Alex,\n\nTo help you understand the concept of the Market Failure, I searched an article in WSJ which includes a market failure and government help. Here is the link: https://www.wsj.com/articles/electric-cars-emit-more-soot-california-ban-gas-powered-vehicles-521b29e3 This article examines the California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, aiming to reduce particulate matter emissions and the associated public health impacts.\n\nLet’s first focus on the definition of the Market Failure. Market failure is an economic term applied to a situation where consumer demand does not equal the amount of a good or service supplied. This means the market now is inefficient. There are different types of market failure, like Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. In the selected article, the type of market failure is Externalities.\n\nExternalities means an indirect cost or benefit to an uninvolved third party that arises as an effect of another party's activity. To be more specific, the situation in this article is negative externality, meaning the social marginal cost is higher than the original marginal cost. In this case, the negative externality is air pollution from cars. The pollution created by cars are emitted into the environment, causing climate changes and other natural disasters. Those disasters will impact all the people living nearby. \n\nIf you draw the demand and supply curve, the social marginal cost line is obtained by shifting the supply curve to the left. And the efficient price and quantity is obtained from the intersection of SMC and demand curve. This efficient price is higher than the autarky price and the efficient quantity is smaller than the autarky quantity.\n\nIn order to push the market towards the efficient point, the government steps in to help. There are three ways that the government can regulate the market: set up environmental standards, levy emissions taxes (Pigouvian Taxes), or make tradable emission permits. Here in this article, the government decides to ban the sale of gasoline-powered cars. This seems to be a good policy, since gasoline-powered cars will emit much more pollution than electric cars. This policy seems to reduce pollution (negative externality). \n\nHowever, the authors points out that electric cars tend to be heavier than their gasoline-powered counterparts, leading to increased tire wear and, consequently, higher emissions of particulate matter from tires. In the meantime, the process of generating electricity to power electric cars can also produce particulate pollution. Therefore, the full costs of electric cars adoption (in terms of particulate pollution from tire wear and electricity generation) are not adequately considered in the decision-making process. The challenge of accurately predicting and addressing the externalities of different technologies appears to be a big issue here.\n\n\nTake care,\n\nStudent\n\n[460 words]\n\nWorks Cited\nMichael Buschbacher and Taylor Myers, (March 3, 2024).

      "essay": "Dear Marty,\nSince you reached out asking for help understanding market failure in our ECON 101\ncourse I thought I could give a relevant real world example to help you visualize the concept.\nMarket failure occurs when the market is not able to reach an efficient outcome without some\nform of intervention. In other words, it is when the market, on its own, cannot reach maximum\ntotal surplus. Recall that total surplus is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer\nsurplus. Remember, the efficient outcome in the market is when the marginal cost intersects the\nmarginal benefit. In the case of externalities, you must consider the external marginal cost and\nbenefit as well, so the efficient outcome is where the social marginal cost intersects the social\nmarginal benefit, the social marginal benefit and cost is the sum of the external marginal benefit\nor cost with the original marginal benefit or cost. This means, in the case of externalities, that the\nefficient outcome and the market equilibrium are not always at the same price and quantity in the\nmarket. Furthermore, this means that when a market with an externality is functioning at the\nequilibrium, there will be deadweight loss within the market from the uncompensated external\ncost or the unobtained external benefit, which, once again, makes the market inefficient and\nhence, failing.\nWithin the New York Times article “They Want to Make Palm Oil in a Lab. Without Palm\nTrees.” by: Dionne Searcey, the concept of a negative externality is present when discussing the\ncopious amounts of pollution released during the current production process of palm oil, where\nproducers deforest mass areas of land through slash and burn to make palm tree farms. Everyone\nin the surrounding areas is reaping the consequences or costs of the pollution, like smoggy air,\npolluted water, and soil depletion. This pollution is a negative externality because it is a cost that\npalm oil producers are imposing on individuals or firms outside of the palm oil market. This\nmeans that the social marginal cost is higher than the marginal cost, and the efficient quantity\nwould be at a higher price and lower quantity than the market is producing currently at its\nequilibrium. So, the current market for palm tree oil is producing too many units of palm tree oil\ncompared to an efficient level, which creates deadweight loss and does not maximize total\nsurplus, which makes this market inefficient and failing.

Market failures occur when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, absent of any intervention (government intervention included). There are a few different ways that a market failure can manifest. There are externalities, which are external benefits or costs that impact a third party that is not accounted for by the market. This either results in the overproduction or underproduction of said externalities. The production of goods can also be a market failure. Goods can be classified according to two attributes: excludable and rival in consumption. Excludable means that one can not access the good unless they pay the set price. Rival in consumption means that the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. A good that is rival in consumption and excludable is called a private good. These goods are set where the market may handle them efficiently, so they are, therefore, not market failures. A good that is rival in consumption but not excludable is called a common resource. A good that is neither rival in consumption nor excludable is called a public good. Lastly, a good that is excludable but not rival in consumption is called an artificially scarce good. \n        Market failures can often be found in news articles. In an article published in the Wall Street Journal titled New Streamer Aims to Fix Watching Sports? There is discussion over a potential new sports streaming service, which is also an example of an artificially scarce good. The current dilemma is that there is not one streaming service that includes all the sports-heavy broadcasting channels. Sports users who don’t use cable TV often have to purchase several streaming subscriptions just to watch all of their favorite sports teams. This article proposes creating a new sports subscription service that combines ESPN+ with 14 sports-heavy channels so sports watchers can pay one subscription fee and attain access to all of their favorite networks. This subscription is set to go for around $40-$60 dollars a month. Users will not be able to access said streaming service if they do not pay the monthly subscription fee. One person streaming will not impact another person's accessibility, meaning that this good is non-rival in consumption. There is no limit to the number of people that can stream this service. Streaming services with a set subscription fee are commonly artificially scarce goods. If the streaming service has an option where users can agree to watch ads rather than pay a subscription, then that is not excludable and, therefore, not an artificially scarce good.\n\nI hope this letter was informative and contributed to your understanding of market failures.\n\nHave a nice week!\n\nBest,\nYour Friend\n\nWord Count: 464\n\nCitation:\n\nMarcelis, D., & Rattner, N.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\n\tI hope all is well at home. In economics recently we’ve been discussing the idea of market failure. Market failure occurs when absent any intervention (including government intervention), the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources. In other words, when the market does not maximize total surplus (total surplus is society’s net gain from the market), even in equilibrium. It is important to acknowledge that equilibrium does not always mean efficiency. Efficiency is maximizing total surplus. Market failure could be due to externalities (an uncompensated cost or benefit that an individual imposes on others), market power (the ability of one or certain businesses to manipulate prices), and non-private goods (due to their difficulty to allocate). \n\tIn a New York Times article about measles vaccinations in Britain, a real-world negative externality example is present. Remember, a negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. The 3rd party receiving it plays no role at all (they are neither the producers producing nor the consumers consuming) and is negatively affected, encountering a cost. Vaccinations, beyond protecting individuals, also contribute to herd immunity, which is a form of indirect protection from infectious diseases that occurs when a large percentage of the population becomes immune to the disease through vaccination, resulting in effectively limiting the spread of the disease, reducing the overall outbreak even for those who are not vaccinated. Those that did not get the vaccination, are unconsciously benefited as a side effect of the action taken by others, resulting in a positive externality. However, when vaccination rates decline, as seen in Britain, herd immunity decreases, and the risk of disease outbreaks increases (Specia). This is a clear example of market failure because of the failure to efficiently allocate resources, vaccinations, in this case, to protect public health, resulting in a situation where total surplus is not maximized. When individuals choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children, they not only put themselves at risk but also others in the community. The situation highlights the failure of the market to account for the full costs and benefits of vaccination. While individuals may choose not to vaccinate due to personal beliefs or preferences, their decision imposes indirect costs on society, in the case, in the form of a disease outbreak. \n\tI hope the information is well received.\nKindly,\nA friend. \n\n\nWord Count:\t405\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\n\n\tSpecia, Megan. “Vaccination Rates Dipped for Years.

      "essay": "To: My friend \n\nSubject: Information About Market Failure \n\nHello Friend,\n\nI heard that you are struggling with the concepts of market failure. Thank you for reaching out to me as I am happy to help you with it! \n\nMarket failure is when the free market is inefficient in terms of the distribution of goods and services. A free market is when there are no taxes or regulations (such as a price ceiling or price floor) from the government on the market in question. Some examples of things that cause market failure are externalities, common goods, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. \n\nRecently, I read an article from the Wall Street Journal that gives an example on how externalities can cause market failure. The article “Stricter Soot Limits Will Save Up to $46 Billion in Healthcare Costs, Federal Officials Say” by Eric Niiler and Jennifer Hiller discusses\nhow environmental restrictions can reduce healthcare costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alleges that enforcing stricter guidelines in regards to soot level in the air will lead to $46 billion in health benefits. The offending parties of the rise in soot levels are industrial facilities, diesel trucks, power plants, road surfaces and factories. \n\nThe market failure that is present within the article is identified to be a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when an individual or party is not included in a transaction, but incurs a cost. That cost is called an ‘external cost’. If an externality is present with a market, then the free market will produce too much of a good or service and sell it at a price that is too low compared to the optimal quantity and price. The optimal quantity and price is found where the marginal social cost is intersecting with the demand curve. The marginal social cost curve takes into account the external cost. In the context of this article, people around the world are suffering health altercations from the soot levels in the air so they bear the external cost. For example, the optimal number of diesel trucks is determined by the diesel truck market, but people throughout the world bear the external cost of the additional pollution in the air even though they are not a part of the diesel truck market. \n\nI hope this example and explanation was of help to you!

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nSo far this semester, we have discussed how free markets allocate resources, that is, how\nthe price and quantity behave with no government intervention. However, sometimes these\nmarkets do not efficiently allocate resources, and that is what we define a market failure to be.\nOne way a market failure may occur is an externality, which is an indirect cost or benefit to a\nthird party. When an indirect cost occurs to a third party, it is called a negative externality. An\nexample of this would be pollution. When large companies have pollution as a byproduct of\nproduction, people in surrounding communities can be negatively affected, even if they have\nnever economically interacted with the company. In this instance, the market produces at a\nhigher quantity than the efficient amount. I found a very insightful article that gives an example\nof a positive externality in this article here.\nThis article discusses the construction of America’s first offshore wind farm, set to power\nLong Island homes. This wind farm will be very powerful,\n“The developers say that South Fork,\nat full strength, could produce 132 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 70,000\nhomes.\n”( Mcgeehan) which will have huge effects on the citizens of Long Island, and\nsurrounding communities, even if those citizens are not financially involved. For one, this\ntransition to clean energy will mean less pollution, which will benefit people, whether they are\nconsuming energy produced by this wind farm, or they are consuming from a different source.\nThis is a perfect example of a positive externality. In this case, the market is producing at a lower\nquantity than the efficient amount. When not intervened with, the demand in the market for\nrenewable energy is lower than the socially efficient amount. If the demand for wind farms was\nat the socially optimal amount, there would be significantly more wind farms, as they cut down\npollution. One can see how the market for wind energy fails to allocate resources efficiently.\nThere are many ways a market can fail, but an externality is a common way market\nfailure occurs. When identifying one, it is important to think about if a third party is being\naffected in a market exchange. If so, the market fails to acknowledge the social cost or benefit, so\nthe supply and/or demand is not representative of societies demand. The amount of the cost is\nprecisely the size of the market failure. I hope this helps with your understanding of market\nfailure.\nSincerely,\nYour Classmate\nWord count: 417\nW\nWorks Cited\nMcgeehan, Patrick, and Joe Buglewicz. “Take a Look at the First Major Offshore Wind Farm to\nPower U.S. Homes.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 Jan. 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/11/nyregion/ny-wind-farm-south-fork.html",

I would be glad to help you enhance your knowledge of market\nfailure.\nA market failure occurs when absent intervention, including government intervention, the market\nfails to reach the efficient outcome, which is when the market does not maximize total surplus,\neven in equilibrium. An important thing to note is that there are several types of market failures:\ncommon resources, public goods, artificially scarce goods, and externalities among other forms\nof imperfect competition that lead to market failure.\nA market failure due to common resources, also known as “tragedy of the commons”, occurs\nwhen people overuse public resources because it reduces the amount that people can use in the\nfuture. A market failure due to public goods, also known as “the free-rider problem”, arises when\na portion of the population benefits from using the good, but does not pay for it. The third type of\nmarket failure is due to artificially scarce goods which occurs when the marginal cost of allowing\none more person to consume a good is lower than the price producers charge. Lastly, a market\nfailure caused by externalities can have negative or positive effects. A negative externality\nproduces an external cost, which is an uncompensated cost that decision makers impose on\nothers. Contrarily, a positive externality produces an external benefit, which is an advantage that\ndecision makers confer on others without receiving compensation.\nIn order to strengthen your understanding of market failure, I discovered an article that includes\nan example of a market failure caused by an externality. The article from the Washington Post,\nWhy Gas Prices Threaten Washington’ s State Fight Against Climate Change, discusses how in\nan attempt to cut back on carbon emissions, the state of Washington has implemented a tax on\nthe largest emitters of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions: oil companies, power plants\nand food producers. Unfortunately, these corporations have the financial means to disregard the\ntax and continue using large amounts of greenhouse gasses to run their companies. This tax has\nonly led to rising gas prices that are solely burdening the general public who use gas to fill up\ntheir vehicles. This market failure is a negative externality because the tax is not halting the use\nof emissions, which is the negative externality, by large corporations. Rather it is compounding\nthe effects of climate change while simultaneously becoming a financial burden to society whose\nuse of gas is negligible in comparison to the larger companies.\nI hope this explanation and example helped you develop your understanding of market failures.\nIf you have any further questions, do not hesitate to reach out.\nBest,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 440\nReferences\nPartlow, J., & Partlow, J.

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\n\n\tMarket failure happens when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome absent any government or other type of intervention. The efficient outcome means that Total Surplus in the market is maximized. Efficiency is not the same as equilibrium, meaning that market failure can occur even when the market is in equilibrium. There are multiple types of market failures: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. \nThere are two types of Externalities. A Negative Externality is when another party’s economic activity indirectly imposes an uncompensated cost (called an External Cost) on a seemingly unrelated third party. A Positive Externality is when another party’s economic activity indirectly confers an uncompensated benefit (called an External Benefit) on a seemingly unrelated third party. When the market in equilibrium does not account for the externality, it fails to maximize Total Surplus and therefore results in market failure. With negative externalities, the market equilibrium results in too many units of the good compared to the efficient level, and vice versa for positive externalities. \nCommon Resources are non-excludable, meaning that consumers do not have to pay producers for the good, and rival in consumption, meaning that the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. Public goods are non-excludable and non-rival in consumption, meaning that one person accessing the good does not prevent others from using it at the same time. Artificially Scarce Goods are excludable, meaning that the supplier of the good can prevent people who do not pay from consuming it, and non-rival in consumption. Common Resources result in market failure as the Social Marginal Cost of using the good exceeds the user’s marginal cost, leading to the market overusing the common resource in equilibrium. Public Goods result in market failure because, by nature, goods that cannot be bought and sold by people cannot be efficiently allocated by the market. Artificially Scarce Goods result in market failure because although the efficient price to consumers for goods that are non-rival in consumption is zero, producers must charge a positive price in order to generate revenue and maximize profit. As a result, the market equilibrium results in a higher price and lower quantity than the efficient outcome.\nThe NYT article Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns illustrates a Negative Externality. Recent studies have found that plastic pollution in the oceans can cause the seafood we eat to be contaminated with microplastics, which has resulted in microplastics being found in human lungs, blood, feces, breast milk, and even the brain. This presents long-term health concerns for seafood producers and consumers, such as an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and low birth weight. Microplastics are a Negative Externality because they are an uncompensated cost to society indirectly resulting from plastic pollution. Market failure has occurred in this scenario because the market prices for plastic goods do not account for this external cost. I hope this real-life example helps you better understand market failure!\n\nSincerely,\nYour Friend\n\nWord Count: 500\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \n\nJacobs, A. (2024, March 9).

Certain goods can actually harm or benefit society. Other goods may not be private goods, meaning they are non excludable or non rival in consumption. It’s also possible for a good to have both of these qualities. A good is excludable if the supplier of that good can prevent people who do not pay from consuming it. A good is rival in consumption if the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. A good that's non excludable could be consumed by people who don’t pay for the good. If a good is non rival in consumption one unit of the good could be consumed by more than one person at the same time. Externalities cause the market to reach an inefficient outcome because these goods are either over consumed or under consumed by society. For example gasoline provides a negative externality because our consumption of it creates harm to the environment and overall causes negative damage to society. A good such as a vaccine is a positive externality because flu shots help prevent everyone from getting sick so by getting one you actually benefit others or bystanders whom you have no relation to. To give an example I’ve found an article about lithium batteries causing explosions and fires in New York City. As of this year there’s been at least three dozen fires caused by ion batteries. These batteries are commonly used in e-bikes but improperly tested and cheap ion batteries are most likely to burst into flames. The gasses produced by these batteries are also toxic and contain heavy metals which not only causes fires to spread faster but the heavy metals endanger firefighters and civilians lungs. When a company knowingly sells an e-bike with an unregulated or cheap lithium battery they produce a negative externality because these goods are liable to cause harm to society and innocent bystanders. On the supply and demand curve this negative externality would be represented as the marginal social cost curve. In the case of the negative externality this curve would be represented as the supply curve plus the marginal social cost. The marginal social cost is the extra external cost imposed on bystanders from one extra unit. The supply curve can also be considered  as the marginal private cost which is The extra cost paid by the seller from one extra unit. These costs are added together to create the marginal social cost curve. This new curve will lie above the marginal private cost curve and intersect with the marginal social benefit or demand curve at a point that is left of the equilibrium quantity. This point should be lower in quantity and higher in price. This new point is called the socially optimal quantity because it is the quantity that we should produce. \n498 words\nSincerely, \nYour friend\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well and that everything is okay at home. I know you're trying to\nkeep up with Econ 101 while dealing with family matters, so I'll try to help clarify the concept of\nmarket failure for you, using a recent article as an example.\nFirstly, market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not\nefficient, often leading to a net social welfare loss. One of the classic examples of market failure\nis externalities, which are costs or benefits that affect a party who did not choose to incur that\ncost or benefit.\nThe New Y ork Times recently published an article titled “Oil Fields Release Far More Methane\nthan Thought, Study Finds,” which serves as a poignant example of market failure due to\nnegative externalities. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is significantly released during oil and\ngas operations. This release contributes to global warming, a cost not accounted for by the\nproducers or reflected in the market price of oil and gas. Here, the negative externality is the\nenvironmental damage and the associated social costs, which are not borne by the oil and gas\ncompanies but by society at large, including future generations dealing with climate change\nimpacts.\nThis situation exemplifies a market failure because the true cost of oil and gas production\n(production costs plus environmental damage) is higher than the cost represented in the market.\nThe market fails to account for these external costs, leading to overproduction and consumption\nof fossil fuels, which exacerbates global warming. This discrepancy between private costs and\nsocial costs is a textbook case of a negative externality leading to market failure.\nIn economic terms, the optimal level of production occurs where social costs equal social\nbenefits. However, in this case, the social costs exceed the private costs faced by the oil and gas\ncompanies, leading to production levels that are higher than socially optimal. The environment,\nacting as a common resource, suffers as a result, and the parties subjected to the negative\nexternality are the general public and the ecosystem, which endure the adverse effects of climate\nchange without direct compensation or choice.\nIt's crucial to understand that while markets are powerful mechanisms for allocating resources,\nthey are not perfect. Externalities like the one discussed in the article show how market outcomes\ncan lead to undesirable social outcomes. Recognizing these failures is the first step in\nconsidering potential solutions, such as government intervention to internalize external costs\n(e.g., through taxes or regulation).\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of market failure and how it applies to\nreal-world issues like environmental pollution. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or\nneed further clarification.\nTake care and stay strong,\nReferences\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Oil Fields Release Far More Methane than Thought, Study Finds.” The New\nY ork Times, 13 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/climate/oil-gas-industry-methane-release.html.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI’m sorry that you’re having to miss class due to an emergency, but I hope this letter is\nable to clarify some things for when you get back. The general concept of a market failure is\nwhen a market fails to be efficient. This failure occurs on its own and without government\nintervention. The market may be operating at its equilibrium price and quantity, but it fails to\nefficiently allocate all goods or services. Thus, there is economic loss in the market, and some\npart of society ends up worse off because their surplus isn’t maximized, which reduces overall\ntotal surplus. Some contributors of market failure that we’ve learned about so far include positive\nand negative externalities, nonexcludable goods, and goods that are nonrival in consumption.\nI’ll be focusing specifically on a case of a negative externality in this letter. First, to\ndefine what a negative externality is, it’s when a third-party incurs an uncompensated cost due to\nthe actions of another party. For example, recently, there have been two Texas fires that have\n“destroyed dozens of homes and delivered a devastating blow to ranches in the region as it\nburned more than 1 million acres in the Texas Panhandle” (Otis and Marchese, 2023). After\nfurther investigation, these fires were determined to be ignited by powerlines belonging to Excl\nEnergy, an electric and gas utility company responsible for powering states across the West and\nMidwest. The company is trying to relieve some of the damage they have caused by asking those\nthat have been affected by the fires to submit claims. This case is a very explicit example of a\nmarket failure in which one party’s actions, Excl Energy’s wildfires, caused damage to a\nthird-party, the residents in the Texas Panhandle. The social marginal cost, which is incurred by\nthe residents, is the total external cost caused by the fires, in addition to the original supply\ncurve. The social marginal cost falls to the left of the supply curve, which in turn, reduces the\nquantity demanded. This causes deadweight loss because there is a greater output of goods in the\nmarket than what is the efficient quantity.\nThis would be classified as a negative externality because a third party, Excl Energy,\nimposed an uncompensated cost, the fires, as they burned down people’s homes and businesses,\neffectively destroying property that once contributed to the local economy.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\tSince you have asked, I will help you to better understand market failures. A market failure is when a market is not being as efficient as it possibly can. Essentially, resources aren’t being allocated in the most effective and efficient manner. This can create problems for both consumers and producers, making them worse off than they could be. \n\tThere are several different types of market failures, one of them being externalities. Externalities can be defined as external costs or benefits that either are imposed or bestowed upon a market. Another way of viewing externalities is a third party, outside of the market, that is affected by some known or unknown factor from within the market. An example of this may be someone inhaling secondhand smoke from another person smoking a cigarette.\n\tI found a good example of this in a news article I read from the Wall Street Journal. The article mentions California’s goal to ban the sale of all gas-powered vehicles by the year 2035. The purpose of this is to cut down on exhaust pollution. This ban would obviously lead to an increase in electric-powered vehicles being used. One would think that this would be a positive externality, however, the article mentions that since electric vehicles are heavier than gas-powered cars, which would lead to more wear on the tires. This, in turn, creates more particulate pollution from the rubber tires, negatively impacting those with weak immune systems to be at greater risk of being harmed. \n\tIn this scenario, you would have a new supply with a higher price and a lower quantity demanded from the negative externality. This new supply is called the social marginal benefit. It essentially appears as a second supply curve that was shifted up if you were to graph it. This new curve creates the efficient outcome where it meets the demand curve or the social marginal benefit curve. However, the electric car market needs help to get there. Before intervention, the electric car market is in autarky. This means that this market operates without any government intervention and is independent. To get the market from its autarky state to the efficient market outcome, the government would have to step in and institute a tax on the production of electric vehicles, which would offset the pollution and put the market into its efficient state. This fundamentally makes the electric vehicle producers pay for the damage being caused by the particulate pollution being emitted from the tires. \n\tIn short, if the government in California doesn’t tax the electric car market, there would be a market failure. This is due to the negative externality caused by the particulate pollution emitted from the tires of electric vehicles. A way to bring the market back to efficiency is to tax the suppliers of electric vehicles. I hope this was helpful in your understanding of market failures.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent\n\nWord Count: 483\n",

Yeah, when I learned about market failure it was confusing as well. The lecture definition of a market failure is that it, “occurs when the market equilibrium is not efficient due to structural failures in the market such as Externalities, Market Power, and Non-Private Goods” (Dudley). Efficiency in the market occurs when the total surplus is maximized. There are two types of externalities in market failure, negative and positive. A Negative Externality occurs when the production or consumption of goods or a service forces costs or impacts others who may not even be part of this. An example of this is traffic, because it impacts you as well as the people around you trying to get to work or are stuck and have an emergency.  A Positive Externality is when the production or consumption of goods or services has a positive impact/benefit on the people around you or society in general. An example of this is getting vaccines because these things not only help you in fighting the sickness but from spreading it to other people as well.  \nI recommend checking out this article:   Johan Rockström Wins ‘Environmental Nobel Prize’ for Identifying the Boundaries of Earth’s Life-Support - WSJ if you want more information on Rockstrom’s research and the market failure associated with it. I’ll give you a quick summary though. The topic of this article is on Johan Rockstrom’s research on the limits of the life support systems that have and hopes to improve upon the Earth’s climate. The market in this article is the fossil fuel industry which is responsible for most of the pollution in the world today. The market failure identified in this article is externalities that have to do with environmental degradation (Pollution). This market failure is classified as a Negative Externality because the actions of producers and consumers involved in fossil fuel production not only impacts the health of the people around but the nearby populations as well. This can be through air pollution produced from the factories to water pollution from the waste that sometimes gets dumped into bodies of water. \nHope this helps with understanding market failures and externalities a bit better, if you have any more questions about market failures or the article, please feel free to email me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord Count: 403\n\nWorks Cited\nToplensky, Rochelle. “Johan Rockström Wins ‘Environmental Nobel Prize’ for Identifying the Boundaries of Earth’s Life-Support.” WSJ.COM, Feb. 2024, \n\t Johan Rockström Wins ‘Environmental Nobel Prize’ for Identifying the Boundaries of     Earth’s Life-Support - WSJ\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIn correspondence to your absence we have covered market failure in class, and while\nreading, “Why People Aged 65 and Older Should Get a Spring COVID V accine,” the prominent\nsocial impact that vaccines hold has allowed me to better explain and understand market failure.\nThe term market failure is better explained by the definition– “market failure is\nassociated with the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often\nleading to a net loss of economic value.” This definition is wordy and may be tricky if you have\nmissed class, in better terms market failure arises when the market equilibrium is not at the level\nefficient to general society. This can be seen through the term externality. There are two types of\nexternalities, positive and negative externalities–a positive externality means that the third party\nbenefits from consumers buying the product. The other type of externality that causes market\nfailure is a negative externality, this hurts the third part and general economy when consumers\nconsume and use this product through negative effects of consumption which causes the market\nto not be at its effective level. Examples of positive externalities are– education,\nlandscaping/home beatification, research and development technology, as well as the most\nknown and prominent one vaccines.\nIn this article, research is given to show why elderly citizens and more specifically\ncitizens 65 and older should be vaccinated this spring. This is a clear example of a positive\nexternality. To better understand and explain this, when someone gets vaccinated obviously, they\nare helping themselves from the disease at hand, but also helping others become less likely to\ncontract the sickness through direct contact. This spillover makes it so both societies are\npositively affected (this is the third party I was explaining earlier) as well as the workforce, and\nan overall healthier population– which leads to significant economic benefit both personally and\nas a country. It's simple, more people vaccinated– leads to fewer people being sick– which\ntranslates to more people working– which in the end increases the finances of companies, and\nindividuals and robustly affects our economy.\nWhile this may be simple and easy to understand on the outside, the free market does not\nunderstand how these benefits can stimulate the economy naturally. This leads to less\nconsumption than is needed to physically alter the economy and society positively— this limited\nconsumption in relation to limited resources and production leads society to not fully experience\nthe full benefit of both positive externalities– vaccines and research and development. A great\ngovernment intervention that would help with this problem would be subsidizing citizens who\nget vaccinated by up to 20$ this would make it so– citizens are more likely to become vaccinated\nas well as incentify companies to continue their research and development of COVID-19, and\nvaccination benefits.\nIn summary, market failure is associated with the market not being at an efficient level,\nand without government interventions, the efficient quantity will likely not be met.\nWORD COUNT - 499\nWork Cited\nArchbald-Pannone, Laurie, and The Conversation US. “Why People Aged 65 and Older\nShould Get a Spring COVID V accine.” Scientific American, 18 Mar. 2024,\nwww.scientificamerican.com/article/why-people-aged-65-and-older-should-get-a-spring-c\novid-vaccine/.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\n\tSince you missed our recent class discussions, I wanted to help you catch up by teaching you about “market failure.” To begin, market failure occurs when, absent of any government intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome. In a perfectly competitive market with ideal conditions, prices and quantities are determined solely by supply and demand, and society’s welfare is maximized. This occurs when the marginal benefit, the satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service, is equal to the marginal cost, the cost of producing one more unit of that good or service. \n\tThe efficient outcome of a market occurs when the market reaches equilibrium, where the price of the good or service reflects its true value to society, and the quantity produced maximizes total societal welfare. However, in the real world, various market imperfections and externalities often lead to market failure, when resources are not properly allocated. One common form of market failure is a negative externality, when the market equilibrium results in too many units of the good compared to the efficient level. In the presence of a negative externality, the production or consumption of a good or service imposes costs on third parties who are not directly involved in the transaction. \n\tNegative externalities lead to market failure for several reasons. Firstly, resources are not allocated efficiently because the price of the good or service does not reflect the full social cost. Producers and consumers make decisions based on this incomplete information and therefore too much of the good or service is produced and consumed, resulting in overproduction and overconsumption. Furthermore, the presence of a negative externality leads to deadweight loss, representing a loss of potential economic efficiency, and inefficiencies. One extremely prevalent type of negative externality in our society is pollution. In this article As leaders fly to Davos, how do private jets fuel climate change? | Context, the “super-rich” are critiqued for their excessive use of private jets. The emissions from private jets impose third party costs on society in the form of air pollution, climate change, and public health impacts. \n\tThere are a few ways in which the government can help the market get back on track. Because only a select group of people are able to use private jets, it is unfortunate that the average citizen still faces the same social and environmental costs of this luxurious service. Therefore, the government can get involved by either interacting directly with the externality or with the market for private jets. If engaging directly with the negative externality (pollution), the government can create environmental standards and rules, impose taxes based on the quantity of pollution produced, or distribute permits that limit the amount of pollution. If engaging with the market for private jets, the government can set technology requirements, tax the service, or set a production quota to limit the quantity of available private jets. \n\tI hope this information helps you to better understand the concept of market failure.\n\n\n499 words.\n",

      "essay": "Dearest Friend,\nI am writing to you in the hopes of clearing up any confusion about market failure to\nmake sure you stay caught up in our Economics class. I know digesting this material can be\ntough outside of the lecture hall, so I’ll relate the topic to a current situation for better\nunderstanding.\nMarket failure essentially means that, without any intervention, a market fails to read the\nefficient outcome. In other words, goods and services aren’t distributed in the best possible way,\npreventing a market from producing and consuming to the best of its ability. On a graph, there\nwill be an equilibrium point and an efficient point, and the difference between the total surpluses\nat those points will create deadweight loss. If you need a refresher, deadweight loss is the lost\ntotal surplus from making a change and because it is lost, is a demonstration of market\ninefficiency. So, measuring the deadweight loss created by the shift from the equilibrium point to\nthe efficient point will highlight that market failure is present. Among other ways, markets can fail\nin the case of a negative externality. This occurs when a person or a group acts in a way that\ncauses uninvolved others to suffer a cost. A simple example would be smokers; when one\nperson smokes in public, those in the surrounding area are subject to secondhand smoke.\nT o make sure you understand market failure, I’ll provide a more in depth example of a\nnegative externality. A recent New York Times article, which I’ll link below, describes how only\nten countries and territories in the world are maintaining World Health Organization air quality\nstandards due to vehicle traffic and increased industrial emissions. (Erdenesanaa) As a result,\ncountries will have to allocate funding to reverse the drastic increase in air pollution. Worldwide\nair pollution is an example of a negative externality because the effects of those driving cars and\nburning fossil fuels makes the air quality unsafe for others. The actions of some are putting an\nuninvolved third party at risk, which will lead to increased spending to reverse air pollution\nalready present or to replace causes with more air safe technologies. National spending when\nresponding to air pollution diminishes funds that would be used to improve a country and\ncreates inefficiency. The total external cost, meaning the money used to respond to the negative\nexternality, will create a leftward shift on the consumer marginal benefit curve. Positive total\nsurplus will shrink and deadweight loss, which is the deadweight loss, will appear on a graph.\nSo, in situations such as the pollution example, the actions of some play a significant\nrole in both the lives of others and the economy overall. When these arise, money and\nresources will be reallocated in an inefficient manner to solve the issue, creating a market\nfailure. I hope my explanation is sufficient, please reach out with questions.\nBest wishes,\n-Your Dearest Friend\n(Word Count: 488)\nErdenesanaa, Delger.\n“One Thing Most Countries Have in Common: Unsafe Air.\n” The New\nYork Times, The New York Times, 19 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/climate/air-pollution-pm25.html?searchResultPosition=1.",

      "essay": "Dear Jerry, \n\nI want to help you to the best of my abilities so that you can feel more confident about your understanding of market failures before your next exam. The easiest way to do that would be to give you an example of market failure in the real world. I found an article that has real-world externalities to do that. \nThe article investigates the repercussions Earth could face as a result of increasing explorations to space. The article explains that, while it is not ideal to limit the space economy and the innovation that comes with it, scientists do not have enough evidence to say the effects that rockets will have on the Earth. When a rocket passes through the middle and upper atmospheres, it will have dumped as much as two-thirds of its exhaust into this reasonably untouched area of Earth's atmosphere. Scientists predict that this pollution from the rockets will rain down and collect in the lower layer of the middle atmosphere, the stratosphere. Ultimately reaching Earth and harming the air that we humans breathe.\nThis is where market failure comes in. The pollution coming from rockets is a negative externality to the people living on Earth who have no involvement in space travel. We have to breathe this polluted air and potentially suffer from the health and environmental effects of pollution. As the Space industry continues to grow, more and more rockets will travel to space, and there is still not enough research to say to what extent this travel is hurting the atmosphere.\nThe negative externality is a cost that the space industry is imposing on all members of society regardless of the fact that the people getting hurt by this did not make the decision to produce this pollution or explore space. \nBecause this market faces the external cost of the negative externality, it will never maximize the total surplus, even in equilibrium. The external cost takes away from the producer surplus even when the market is in equilibrium and takes the chunk out of the potential surplus the market could be producing. The only way to combat this and make sure the market is at efficiency, meaning it maximizes total surplus, the government must intervene. For instance, the government would impose an emissions tax or maybe even implement tradable emissions permits, which allow companies holding the permit to produce only a certain amount of emissions, and then if they are able to produce less, they can sell their unused emissions to a company that is willing to buy more. \nThe article I am referring to is attached below.

      "essay": "Dear [Friend],\nI hope this message finds you well and I have heard that you are struggling with the\nconcept of market failure. Market failure occurs when the allocation of resources and services by\na free market is not efficient, often leading to negative outcomes that are not accounted for in the\nmarket price. This is shown in forms such as externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods.\nOne very easy but major form of a market failure is in the form of an externality. This is\nwhere there are costs or benefits that are experienced by people or 3rd parties that are not\ndirectly related to the market. For example, the article “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, A New\nFilm Warns,” dives into the negative externality of microplastic pollution, highlighting how the\nwidespread use of plastics has led to many unintended consequences for the environment and\nhuman health (Jacobs 2024).\nPlastics have been a massive convenience in the modern day world but their durability\nmeans that they exist in the environment long after their use ends. This article points out that the\nUnited Nations has estimated most of the 400 million metric tons of place produced annually\nwill remain on Earth, breaking down into microplastics. These tiny particles have been found\neverywhere, from ocean habitats to the human body, posing many health risks. This situation\nillustrates a classic case of a negative externality where the producers and consumers of plastic\ngoods enjoy the benefits but society at large, future generations, and the environment bear the\nhidden costs. This includes the pollution of ecosystems, health risks, and the destruction of\nmarine life (Jacobs 2024).\nRecent studies have found microplastics in vital organs and tissues within the human\nbody which is very alarming as people become more likely to encounter health issues. This\ndiscovery suggests that the problem of plastic pollution is not just about littering or harming\nmarine life but about the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food that we eat is\ncontaminated with plastic particles. The documentary “Plastic People,” mentioned in the article\nemphasizes the urgency of addressing plastic pollution and its far-reaching effects on human\nhealth and the environment (Jacobs 2024).\nSo we have this negative externality but now what? Because negative externalities are not\ninternalized in the price and cost, it leads to overproduction and overconsumption of plastics.\nThis market failure would justify government intervention, such as taxation on plastic goods to\nreflect their true societal costs, subsidies to alternatives, or just regulations limiting production\nand use.\nIn conclusion, the case of microplastic pollution describes the concept of market failure\nthrough a negative externality. I hope this explanation helps clarify everything and please feel\nfree to reach out if you have any more questions.\nBest,\nY our friend\nWord count: 466\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times,\nThe New Y ork Times, 9 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?sear\nchResultPosition=4.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \nThis week in class we discussed market failures and how they play a role in the economy. First, a market failure takes place when, absent any government intervention, the market is not able to achieve the efficient outcome and therefore does not maximize total surplus. Market efficiency occurs when the maximum total surplus is reached and social marginal benefit intersects social marginal cost. There are four types of failure that we learned – externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce resources. \nExternalities in the market can be either positive or negative. A positive externality, also known as an external benefit, is a benefit given to an unrelated third party making them better off without any compensation for doing so. A negative externality, also known as an external cost, is when there is a cost imposed on a third party making them worse off. The reason as to why externalities cause market failure is because the price of the goods or services does not accurately reflect the costs or benefits of that good or service in a given market. \nTypes of goods are another area of market failure and includes four different categories of goods depending on whether they are excludable, non-excludable, rival in consumption, or nonrival in consumption. A good is excludable when there is a price that stops certain people from consuming the good, and is non-excludable when there is no price to pay. A good is rival in consumption when it cannot be consumed by more than one person at a given time, and is non-rival when it is available to anyone at any time. Common resources are non-excludable and rival in consumption, public goods are non-excludable and non-rival in consumption, and artificially scarce goods are excludable and non-rival in consumption. Due to the fact that these non-private goods are only one of the two, but not both excludable and rival in consumption, they cannot be efficiently allocated by the market. Thus, total surplus is not maximized, resulting in market failure. \nTo help you further understand market failure, I found an article that described a negative externality - pollution. Published by The NYT the article, Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warms, highlights the dangers microplastics have in regards to human health. According to the article, scientists have discovered an abundance of microplastics found in living creatures, specifically the seafood that we eat. Microplastics were also found in human lungs, blood, feces, and even breast milk. The market failure type that is shown in the article is externalities, and the health consequences as a result of the microplastics are considered a negative externality - an external cost provided by plastic manufacturers and imposed on third party individuals. The cost of plastic goods does not account for the imposed negative health effects society is facing, proving to be an externality and therefore causing a market failure. \n\nSincerely, \nYour Friend\n\nWord Count: 477\n\n\n\nSource: \nJacobs, A.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope you're doing well with everything that's happening. I appreciate your dedication to keeping up with our Econ 101 class despite your circumstances. You mentioned having trouble understanding market failure so I wanted to share an example I recently came across that might help clarify things.\nMarket failure is a concept that occurs when the distribution of goods and services, in a free market, is not efficient leading to a negative impact on society's overall well being. It specifically refers to situations where the market's outcome's not ideal for society often due to factors like externalities, public goods, common resources or goods that are artificially scarce. Externalities are costs or benefits that affect parties who didn't choose to bear those costs or enjoy those benefits. Negative externalities in particular occur when the production or consumption of a product imposes costs on others that aren't considered in the market price.\nAn interesting instance of market failure due to an externality was discussed in an article, from The Wall Street Journal titled \"AIs Energy Consumption; A Growing Concern.\" The article sheds light on the impact and sustainability issues arising from the increasing electricity usage of intelligence technologies. With the advancement of AI and its integration, into aspects of life and industries, there is a possibility that its electricity requirements could greatly increase the global demand, for power. \nThis surge in electricity usage, in turn, presents obstacles to the decarbonization of energy sources, showcasing a stark example of market failure where the environmental costs of AI's electricity consumption are not incorporated into the market prices of AI technologies or their applications.\nThis situation exemplifies a negative externality because the broader societal and environmental costs of AI's electricity consumption are borne not by the producers or consumers of AI technologies but by society at large. The market, in this case, fails to account for these costs, leading to overconsumption of energy resources and underinvestment in energy efficiency and sustainability measures. The disconnect between the private benefits gained from AI and the public costs of increased energy consumption highlights the essence of market failure.\nUnderstanding this example is crucial for recognizing how externalities can lead to inefficient market outcomes and the role of government intervention, such as taxes or regulations, in correcting these failures. By internalizing the external costs through policy measures, we can align individual incentives with the social good, thereby addressing the market failure.\nI hope this detailed example helps demystify the concept of market failure for you. If you have any questions or need further explanations, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your resilience and dedication to learning during this challenging time are truly inspiring.\nTake care and looking forward to your return,\n[Word Count: 454]\n\n",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3\nI recently heard you needed help understanding market failure and everything involved.\nFirst, I’m going to explain what market failure is. In general terms, market failure is when the\nmarket fails to reach an efficient outcome, meaning it does not maximize total surplus, without\nany intervention occurring within the market. An inefficient outcome could occur even when a\nmarket is in equilibrium. A market failure could be identified by looking at the total surplus of\nequilibrium, and then looking at the total surplus of the efficient outcome, and comparing them.\nIf they’re different then the market is failing. One way this could occur is if the market is\naffected by externalities. A negative externality happens when an uncompensated cost is imposed\non another, while a positive externality is when an individual or firm benefits another without\nreceiving compensation for the benefit. Another way a market failure can occur is from the type\nof good it is. For example, if the good is non-excludable( so either a common resource or a\npublic good), there is a high chance of having a free-rider problem. A free-rider problem is when\npeople who did not pay for the construction of the good use it. When this occurs, the markets\nequilibrium no longer aligns with the efficient outcome as the maximum total surplus is being\naltered by the free-riders. A similar issue happens when there is an artificial good, it is once\nagain difficult to maximize total surplus as it virtually costs no money to provide the good(for\nexample Netflix), but they still decide to charge money, which once again changes the efficient\noutcome from the equilibrium price.\nTo demonstrate this, I will talk about a recent event that happened in Texas, which\nexposed a market failure. This article was updated on March 7th, 2024, but the actual incident\noccurred on February 26th, 2024(Otis, 2024). It is said that one of the biggest wildfires in Texas\nhistory was caused by power lines– specifically Xcel Energy’s power line equipment due to a\nlack of maintenance(Otis, 2024). In this specific case, a market failure is occurring due to a\nnegative externality. It has already been stated that over 1 million acres of land have been burned\nand have yet to be fully contained(Otis, 2024). Not only that, there have been over 60 houses\ndestroyed by the fire that was caused by the power lines– a clear negative externality (Otis,\n2024). The power line has indirectly caused multiple people to lose their homes and livestock.\nSo, even if the power line market was in equilibrium, that is not the efficient outcome. The\nefficient outcome differs from equilibrium as the social marginal cost is no longer equal to the\nproducer marginal cost as there is also an external marginal cost to include. With the destruction\nof land and homes being the external marginal cost.\nWord Count:471\nWorks Cited\nOtis, G. A. (2024, March 7). Power lines sparked largest wildfire in Texas history.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nThanks for your kind email the other day. I’m really sorry to hear about your family emergency—I know homework help can’t make up for it, but hopefully it’ll ease your struggles a little.  \nAnyway, I’ve been looking for examples of market failures, and I think this New York Times article is a really interesting one. As you can see, the article talks about how commercial space exploration could potentially have major negative effects on the environment because of the pollutants, soot, and emissions space exploration creates. This touches on two of the market failure examples we’ve discussed in class so far—namely, externalities and non-private goods. \nBefore we start, we need to define our terms. A market failure refers to any scenario where the market outcome doesn’t maximize total surplus for a particular good (social marginal benefit doesn’t match social marginal cost). Externalities refer to cases where market activity imposes extra costs or benefits on bystanders, which the market fails to take into account. And non-private goods refer to any goods which are nonexcludable, non-rival in consumption, or both. \nThe space pollution scenario addressed in The Times is one obvious example of an externality. Specifically, it’s a negative externality, which occurs when the market creates external costs. Negative externalities are market failures because the market fails to take into account the external costs of the goods/services it produces. This means the optimal quantity of that good is lower than the market quantity.  In this scenario, the market quantity of spacecraft launches reflects the producer marginal cost and consumer marginal benefit of space exploration, but fails to reflect the external cost of space pollution. Because of this, total surplus might be lower than at the efficient quantity of space launches, because of the external cost of “cumulative exhaust from more rockets….local ozone holes….[and] metals from re-entering spacecraft” (Hall). \nThe article also features one of the three major categories of common goods—common resources. As we discussed in class, common resources are both nonexcludable and rival in consumption—everyone can access them without paying, but only one person can use a unit of the resource at a time. Because of this, common resources are prone to overuse—individuals will consume the resource until their individual marginal benefits reflect their individual marginal costs, but the resulting market equilibrium won’t reflect the social marginal cost of consuming that good. In this particular scenario, space corporations are using our atmosphere to launch rockets, but, if they don’t take the cost of overuse into account, the amount of launches and reentries could quickly ruin the quality of the upper atmosphere and the ozone layer. \nAs the article also notes, there are solutions to these problems. The article explicitly identifies one solution—regulations. In addition, governments could use Pigouvian taxes to force markets to incorporate externalities into their decisionmaking. Furthermore, governments could cap the number of space launches with a quota. \nHopefully that helps!\nSincerely, Friend\nWord count: 485\n\nHall, Shannon. “The New Space Race Is Causing New Pollution Problems.” The New York Times, 22 January 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/science/rocket-pollution-spacex-satellites.html.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI am writing to you to help you understand market failure, a concept we learned\nin our economics class. Market failure occurs when the market fails to maximize total\nsurplus within the market, which means that the market fails to be efficient. This occurs\nwithout any external intervention, including by the government.\nMarket failure can be caused by positive and negative externalities. Positive\nexternalities, also known as external benefits, are when an individual, or a company,\nunintentionally creates a benefit for an unrelated party. On the other hand, negative\nexternalities, also known as external costs, occur when an individual or a company, for\nexample, creates a cost that is imposed on an unrelated party.\nOne example of this is a company producing pollution in the process of\nproducing a product, which as a result, negatively impacts people’s health, who had no\nrole in producing the pollution. This example of market failure is illustrated in an article\npublished by NPR, where the author discusses the major problem of pollution in the US,\nand the EPA’s attempt to combat this by setting stricter limits of allowable PM2.5 levels.\nPollution is a negative externality because big contributors of pollution are large\nindustries processes, like “agriculture, and industrial processes” (Borunda), while those\naffected are citizens, who did not contribute directly to the pollution. This causes market\nfailure as the external cost of pollution is not taken into account into the overall market.\nThis means the market equilibrium does not reach the efficient outcome and fails to be\nsocially efficient, as it does not maximize total surplus.\nMarket failure can be represented graphically. With negative externalities, a new\nsocial marginal cost curve is created as a result of the negative externality. The social\nmarginal cost curve in this case would be the producers marginal cost, which is the\noriginal supply curve, plus the external marginal cost. This is shifted to the left of the\noriginal supply curve, while the demand curve remains unchanged. This means that the\nefficient quantity demanded is lower than the original market quantity, which causes a\ndeadweight loss, or negative total surplus. Additionally, this means that the efficient\nprice is higher than the price of the market. Society’s total net gain is maximized where\nthe social marginal benefit curve interests the social marginal cost curve, which is where\nthe new efficient equilibrium is. The overall positive surplus is however lower than the\ntotal surplus before.\nThe government can help fix the market failure in two ways: engaging with the\nexternality, or engaging with the market of the good. For engaging with the externality of\npollution, the government can create emission taxes, also called Pigouvian T axes,\nwhich creates a tax based on the amount of pollution created. For the good, the\ngovernment can create technology standards, for electricity for example, which creates\npollution, which would overall help to decrease the amount of pollution produced.\nI hope this letter gave you a better understanding of how market failure works.\nSincerely,\nYour Friend\nWord Count: 497\nWork Cited\nBorunda, Alejandra. “EPA tightens rules on some air pollution for the first time in over a\ndecade.” NPR, 7 February 2024,\nhttps://www.npr.org/2024/02/07/1229348646/epa-tightens-rules-on-some-air-poll\nution-for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIt is essential to know about market failures and their causes. Here is a current example to\nhelp your understanding.\nA market failure happens when the market does not reach an efficient outcome, meaning\ntotal surplus is not maximized, without any form of intervention (including government\nintervention). An externality is an example of something that can contribute to the failure of a\nmarket. Externalities can be positive, yielding some external benefit to society, or negative,\nimposing some external cost on society. These external costs and benefits are not accounted for\nby the market which is why total surplus is not maximized and the market does not operate at its\nfull efficiency.\nThis article from The New Y ork Times discusses a recent market failure in our own\neconomy. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with doing exactly as its name\nsuggests: protecting the environment and those living in it from potential risks to their health.\nPart of this role is to restrict the amount of pollution that companies can emit annually as they\nnot only harm the environment but can also create serious health issues for those living in close\nproximity to the source of the pollutants. One way they recently attempted to combat this\nproblem was by further lowering the number of yearly emissions companies can have. These\nnew limitations prompted almost half of the states in the country to sue the EPA arguing that they\nwill hurt producers and consumers financially, raising costs for both in order to account for the\nchanges needed to lower emissions. Clearly this is a contentious issue balancing economic\ninterests with the health of the general population as some of the states are viewing these new\nlimitations as crossing a line while the EPA and others view it as a basic protection for people.\nThe market failure in this situation is the cost of pollution for society, particularly the health\nconsequences imposed on people by pollution.\nPollution is a negative externality for this particular failure. The social marginal cost of\npollution exceeds the social marginal benefit, meaning total surplus is not maximized and\ntherefore contributing to market inefficiency. Though the products themselves are not creating\nthe pollution causing negative health outcomes for people, the pollution is something additional\nbeing put into the world during the production and consumption process. Goods produced in\nfactories that pollute are then sent to stores for purchase by means of a vehicle with an internal\ncombustion engine. If the product is plastic for example, then the consumer can contribute to\npollution by not disposing of it properly. The cycle continues. The states suing the EPA say that\nsetting new emission limits will raise costs for producers and consumers, but when considering\npollution as a negative externality, one could argue that these increased costs are the costs\ntypically unaccounted for in the market coming to life.\nI hope this was able to give you some clarity about market failure!\nFrom,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 490\nWork Cited\nFriedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A.

      "essay": "To: My Econ 101 Friend\nSubject: Market Failure\nMarket failure occurs due to an inefficient allocation of goods and services. It fails to\nmaximize total surplus, for total surplus acts as an efficient allocation of resources within the\neconomy. Market efficiency is a result of every good or service being consumed or produced to\nits optimal amount, so the market fails when not all costs or benefits related to the consumption\nor production of goods and services are taken into account. A type of market failure is\nexternalities, which is an external cost, that a firm or individual inflicts on others, or a benefit,\nthat a firm or individual inflicts on others without that benefit being reflected in their\ncompensation. Negative externalities are the external costs unaccounted for by the market that\nnegatively affect a third party apart from the producer and consumer, and positive externalities\nare the external benefits unaccounted for by the market that positively affect a third party. These\nexternalities cause market failure, for total surplus is not maximized when these externalities are\nnot accounted for within market transactions.\nIn the news story, “A Y ear after Ohio Derailment, U.S. Freight Trains Remain Largely\nUnregulated,” presented by Tonya Mosley, there is a clear example and illustration of a negative\nexternality that causes market failure. Mosley analyzes the issue of the lack of regulations on\nUnited States freight trains, following the derailment of “38 cars in a Norfolk Southern freight\ntrain…in East Palestine, Ohio, igniting a massive chemical fire.”1 The freight train system is\nmostly unregulated, with the Federal Railroad Administration monitoring less than 1 percent of\nfreight train activity, and “the industry also does not report the length of freight trains, some of\n1 Mosley, T onya.\nFeb. 2024.\n“A Year after Ohio Derailment, U.S. Freight Trains Remain Largely Unregulated.\n” NPR, 8\nwhich can stretch up to two miles.”2 The lack of regulation on freight trains has increased safety\nconcerns within communities across the United States as well as has had negative effects on the\nenvironment. In Hammond, Indiana, community members claim “that blocked railroad crossings\nprevented life-saving care for family members, and led to their death.”3 These negative effects of\nsafety and environmental concerns that are affecting community members not associated with\nthe freight train system are examples of negative externalities, for these community members\naffected are third-party individuals, not producers or consumers within the freight system. The\nchemical fire in East Palestine, Ohio, and the prevention of life-saving care for family members\nin Hammond, Indiana both created external costs of the freight system that are unaccounted for\nin the market.

      "essay": "Subject: Understanding Market Failure: A Recent Example\nThe next topic in our economics class is market failure and I am writing to explain it to\nyou to help build my own understanding. Market failure is when the allocation of goods and\nservices in a free market is not efficient. Essentially this means that the free market fails to\nproduce the optimal outcome for society as a whole and the total surplus is not maximized. One\ncould perform a marginal analysis of a market failure by subtracting the total surplus of the\nmarket outcome from the efficient outcome. Often this occurs when the failure creates an\nexternality. A positive externality is when there is an uncompensated benefit and a negative\nexternality is when there is an uncompensated cost on a third party. Market failures can be\ncaused by externalities, imperfect competition, information asymmetry, and public goods.\nThe best way of understanding a market failure is by learning to identify them. There are\nmany instances of market failure in the daily news. I just came across an article in the New York\nTimes, that talks about the rise of microplastics in the oceans, the food we eat, and the water we\ndrink. At first glance, this may not seem like it relates directly to market failure. However, the\narticle describes a form of pollution which is a negative externality. The many companies that\nproduce plastic products all contribute to plastic pollution. This pollution is uncompensated costs\nthat companies don’t have to pay for. The rest of society must suffer from microplastics in their\nfood and their organs due to the production of the plastic goods.\nT o better understand the situation let's say that a company is producing plastic water\nbottles. The company pays for the labor, materials, and transportation for producing the water\nbottle. However, there is a marginal social cost that doesn’t account for the environmental\ndamages caused by the disposal of the water bottle. When consumers buy plastic products they\nuse plastic but also do not consider the environmental impact. Now that there is so much plastic\nin the environment the cost of clean-up efforts falls onto the whole society. Even those who do\nnot consume plastic products must bear this cost.\nIn an efficient market, the producers and consumers would pay for these costs. For the\nconsumers and producers to pay these costs the government would have to intervene by\nplacing taxes and quotas on plastic products or by enforcing environmental standards on\nbusinesses.\nThis is just one example of market failure but it shows how the pursuit of profit does not\nalways lead to an efficient outcome. Policymakers and economists must analyze these\nsituations to find the best course of action to resolve market failures. If you are curious about\nlearning more about microplastics I have included the article below. I hope this provides you\nwith a better understanding of what a market failure is and why it occurs.\nBest,\nJacobs, Andrew.\n“Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.\n” The New York\nTimes, The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html\nWord Count: 484",

      "essay": "To: My Friend \nSubject: Market Failure \n\n\tI wish you and your family well through these hard times and hope this email will provide you with a better understanding of market failure. \nMarket failure occurs when a market is unable to reach its efficient outcome without any government intervention. There are several types of market failure, including common resources, public goods, externalities, and artificially scarce goods. To further expand upon this concept, I will center my explanation around externalities, which are side effects exterior to the production and consumption of goods that impact third parties. There are two kinds of externalities: positive and negative. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that unintentionally affects an outside party. This cost, combined with all private costs borne by producers, characterizes the social marginal cost, or total cost to society that arises from one additional unit of production. A positive externality is the opposite of a negative externality. It is an uncompensated benefit that affects an outside party in a way that the market does not consider. In the same way, the social marginal benefit contrasts with the social marginal cost. It is the combination of the benefits enjoyed by consumers, and the external benefits accrued to a third party. The market is always working towards an efficient standing; it is always trying to maximize its total surplus. However, external marginal costs and benefits limit this endeavor, causing the government to intervene by imposing a tax, subsidy, or regulation. The effects that these exterior costs and benefits can have on the market, and society as a whole, emphasize the profound nature of externalities. \nA real-world example of a market failure can be found in the article “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P.A Over New Limits on Deadly Production” by the New York Times. This piece expands upon the current dispute between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Republican Attorneys General over the EPA’s decision to lower annual limits on fine particulate matter production. These tiny particles are a form of air pollution that “can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream, increasing the risk of heart disease, asthma, and low birth rates”(CITE). The previous market outcome, or market efficiency, stood at 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, but after the EPA released its decision, the efficient outcome now stands at 9 micrograms. In this case, the market failure of focus is air pollution. The production of fine particulate matter particles, arising from power plants, is a negative externality as it unintentionally imposes health costs on surrounding environments. Because producers of power do not bear these societal costs, they have had no incentive to reduce the production of pollution particles to socially optimal levels; all social costs have been greater than private costs, creating a new market efficiency problem. This incited the EPA to establish a lower environmental standard, and thus, regulate the market. \n\tHopefully, I was able to clarify the idea of a market failure through this example.  \nBest, \nYour Friend \n\nWord Count: 490  \n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nFriedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P.A. over New Limits on Deadly Pollution.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 6 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=1. \n \n",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nHello, I hope all is well with you. I understand that you would like some clarification\nregarding the current course material, market failure. Thus, I will do my best to assist you.\nLuckily, I have recently come across a news article that highlights market failure quite well.\nHowever, I will begin by providing you with a more general overview of market failure.\nFirst, it is important to understand that a market failure occurs when the economy fails to\nallocate resources efficiently. This generally results in a negative effect on society. Note that\nthere are four unique types of market failure that we covered in class: externalities, common\nresources, public goods, and artificially scarce resources. To aid you better, I can briefly explain\neach. Externality market failure is essentially the side effects of economic activity, such that their\ncost is not reflected in the affected good or service. Common resource market failure generally\nrefers to the overuse or depletion of a good or service due to its rivalrous but non-excludable\nnature. Public goods market failure typically occurs due to the unavailability of a good or service\ncaused by a lack of financial incentive to produce them. Lastly, an artificially scarce good market\nfailure occurs when a good or service has a barrier or restriction that leads to it being heavily\nunderutilized.\nTo further your understanding of market failure, we can examine a recently published\narticle by The New Y ork Times, titled, “A Quarter of Freshwater Fish Are at Risk of Extinction,\na New Assessment Finds.” As you can infer, the article covers the endangerment of freshwater\nfish. It specifically highlights the many factors harming freshwater populations. The most\nimportant of such factors are pollution and overfishing. In examining pollution, we can identify it\nas an externality of market failure. More specifically, it is a negative externality due to the\nextremely harmful effects of pollution on the fish population. We must also note that the effects\nof pollution are not being dealt with by its producers, instead they are borne by freshwater\necosystems. Thus creating a relationship where these producers of pollution face immediate\nbenefit, however, they are disregarding the negative long-term societal effects. This is\nparticularly important because it was found that pollution is the biggest threat to freshwater fish\npopulations (Einhorn, 2023).\nAnother market failure that the article mentions is overfishing. In this case, we can\nidentify overfishing as a common resource market failure. As previously mentioned, a common\nresource market failure typically occurs due to the depletion or over usage of a particular\nresource. In this case, producers in the market of fish-related products are overextending their\nbounds in an attempt to generate a higher level of revenue. This drives the freshwater fish\npopulation down and harms the freshwater ecosystems, creating a market failure.\nI hope this email finds you well, if you have any questions feel free to reach out. I also\nhighly recommend you examine the linked article for yourself.\nBest Regards,\nHelpful Classmate\nArticle Link:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/climate/climate-change-threatened-species-red-list.html?se\narchResultPosition=10\nWord Count: 493\nWorks Cited\nEinhorn, Catrin. “A Quarter of Freshwater Fish Are at Risk of Extinction, a New Assessment\nFinds.” The New York Times, 11 Dec. 2023.",

      "essay": "Hey there!\nI trust this email finds you in good health. Y ou noted in our most recent session that you were\nhaving trouble understanding the idea of market failure in your Econ 101 class. I thought I would\nprovide an example from a recent news article to assist explain this idea. Comprehending market\nfailures is crucial since they bring to light instances in which the market fails to allocate\nresources effectively, resulting in adverse consequences for society.\nWhen a product is produced or consumed in a way that affects a party not directly involved in\nthe transaction, a market failure occurs. Market pricing do not account for this impact, which\ncould have a positive (benefit) or negative (cost) effect. We refer to these as externalities. Public\ncommodities (non-excludable and non-rival), common resources (non-excludable but rival), and\nartificially scarce goods (excludable but non-rival) are examples of further market failures.\nLet's examine a contemporary scenario that exemplifies market failure, paying special attention\nto externalities. According to a recent report, California's plan to prohibit the sale of new\ngasoline-powered cars by 2035 in order to minimize particulate matter emissions is being\nreviewed by the Biden administration. This is an effort to control the kinds of cars that are\nmarketed in order to mitigate a negative externality (pollution).\nThe report highlights that new gasoline-powered cars are extremely clean, accounting for only\napproximately 1% of California's total direct fine particulate matter. This is where the twist lies.\nNot the exhaust of these newer vehicles, but tire wear is the primary source of pollution. It's\ninteresting that the drive for electric cars (EVs), which are perceived as having \"zero emissions\"\nsince they don't have tailpipes, ignores the fact that EVs' heavier weight and thus increased tire\nwear might actually increase particle emissions.\nThis instance brings to light several important ideas about market failure:\nExternalities: One negative externality that is not taken into consideration in the cost of cars is\nthe health effects of particulate matter. Although California's policy tries to lessen this, it might\nnot successfully address the underlying reason.\nResources that are Common: Although everyone utilizes air quality, it cannot be abused or\ndeteriorated because no one owns it.\nThis illustration serves as a helpful reminder of the difficulties in correcting market failures.\nAlthough the goal of California's prohibition is to reduce air pollution and safeguard public\nhealth, the actual result may not be as beneficial as expected because important aspects such as\ntire wear emissions from electric vehicles have been overlooked. It showcases the importance of\nthoroughly evaluating policies to ensure they effectively address the intended market failure\nwithout unintended consequences.\nI hope this helps clear up the concept of market failure for you!

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well despite the challenging circumstances. I'm sorry to hear about\nyour family emergency, and I'm here to help you stay on track with Econ 101 as much as I can. I\nunderstand that the concept of market failure has been a bit confusing, so I'll do my best to\nclarify it using a recent news article as an example.\nMarket failure is the result of inefficient distribution of goods and services by a free market,\nwhich reduces net social welfare. A number of factors, including externalities, shared resources,\npublic goods, and artificially scarce products, may cause this.\nThe article “Supreme Court Seems Ready to Block a Biden Plan on Air Pollution”\nprovides an excellent example of market failure related to externalities. Externalities are\nexpenses or advantages that have an impact on people or organizations who are not directly\ninvolved in a market exchange. To address air pollution that drifts across state lines, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) put up a \"good neighbor\" proposal in this instance. The\ngoal of the initiative was to lessen ozone pollution that seeps into Eastern regions from Western\nand Midwestern industrial and power plants.\nThe fact that the polluting states do not pay the full cost of their pollution is the source of this\nmarket failure. The downwind states bear the financial burden of pollution, including health\nproblems and environmental harm, even though they did not initiate the pollution. This is a\nclassic case of a negative externality, in which expenses are imposed on others (the downwind\nstates) without any compensation due to the acts of one party (the polluting states).\nBy forcing the polluting states to lower their emissions, the EPA's strategy attempted to\ninternalize this externality. But if the Supreme Court decides to restrict the EPA's jurisdiction, it\nmight make this market failure worse by letting the polluting states keep polluting without\nhaving to pay the full price for their activities.\nIn summary, negative externalities—a situation in which certain governments are able to pollute\nat the expense of others due to a lack of regulation—are a clear example of market failure in this\ninstance. This illustration emphasizes how crucial government action is in addressing market\nimperfections and guaranteeing a more effective use of available resources.\nI hope that my explanation makes the idea of market failure more understandable for you. Do not\nhesitate to contact us if you need any additional information or if you have any more queries.

      "essay": "Greetings classmate,\nIn this email, I will be providing you an overview on market failure. Market failure is a\nsituation, without government intervention, the market fails to achieve an efficient outcome.\nWhen mentioning market failures, two categories are important to understand— excludability\nand rivalry. Excludability is when suppliers limit non-paying access of a goods and rivalry is a\nperson's consumption excluding others. Market failure includes Common goods, artificially\nscarce goods, and public goods.\nI want to address the two types of market failures. Firstly, there is Positive externality,\nindication of failure on the demand side. This occurs when a firm provides an external benefit\nwithout receiving compensation for it. Individuals that enjoy these benefits without incurring\ncost are commonly referred to as free riders. For instance, the flu vaccine market those who did\nnot receive the vaccine can be categorized as free riders, benefiting from herd immunity without\npaying a cost. This external benefit introduces a new demand curve known as the social marginal\nbenefit, intersecting with the supply curve at the market's efficient quantity. Now, negative\nexternalities are a failure on the supply side that occur when a firm imposes an uncompensated\nexternal cost on others.The external cost allows for a new supply curve to appear, called social\nmarginal cost curve, which intersects with demand at the market efficient quantity. The attached\narticle below touches base with negative externalities, in which I will use as an example of\nmarket failure.\nThe article below illustrates negative externalities associated with the pollution market\nemitted by cars, particularly focusing on California's banning plan on gasoline powered cars.\n“The newer gasoline cars that California wants to ban will often have particulate filters that\nreduce emissions to below one 1/1,000th of a gram per mile driven”(Bushbacher, 2024). The\nproblem with this is that it’s not entirely true as electric cars' total emissions went up compared\nto gasoline ones. This is a prime example of negative externalities as carbon emission is directly\ncorrelated with an increase of total carbon emission. Both the produce and consumer don’t\nrealize the this cost and are able to reach the highest total individual surplus at equilibrium.\nConsequently, society as a whole would benefit from a total surplus at a lower quantity due to\npollution (CO2) being related to the external cost.\nThis market demonstrates how the equilibrium quantity exceeds the efficient level due to\nthe pollution externalities. To help this the government can employ two strategies: ta or quota.\nBoth strategies aim to shift the supply curve at the social marginal cost, alining production with\nthe efficient quantity. A quota would allow for a pollution limit to be set, allowing a challenge\ndue to demand and supply variations. (455)\nBest,\nClassmate",

As your classmate, I am here to help you with any\nconcepts about market failure you have trouble understanding.\nMarket failure occurs when there is an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the\nfree market. In other words, the outcomes of market interactions do not lead to the ideal resource\nallocation in society, resulting in social welfare loss. As for what the class has learned, Dr.\nDuduely introduced us to two types of market failure: Externalities & Types of Goods.\nExternalities occur when the actions of an individual or firm in an economic transaction\naffect the social welfare of a third party who is not directly involved in the transaction. In the\ncase of an externality, the market does not maximize total surplus even at market equilibrium,\nfailing to achieve an efficient outcome.\nThere are two types of Externalities:\n● Negative Externality occurs when the actions of an individual or firm impose costs on\nothers.\n○ Example: Pollution\n● Positive Externality occurs when the actions of an individual or firm impose benefits on\nothers without compensation.\n○ Example: Education\nTypes of Goods- Goods are classified into four main types based on two conditions:\nExcludability and Rivalry in Consumption.\nFour Types of Goods:\n● Private Goods (Excludable & Rivalry Consumption)\n● Public Goods (Non-Excludable & Non-Rivalry Consumption) - This leads to freerider\nissues, where individuals refuse to pay for goods because they can benefit from them\nwithout paying.\n● Common Resources (Non-Excludable & Rivalry Consumption) - This leads to resource\noveruse or depletion.\n● Artificially Scarce Goods (Excludable & Non-Rivalry Consumption) - This leads to\nmarket inefficiencies, as the goods are not being allocated according to demand due to\nexternal limitations.\nTo further illustrate the concept of market failure, I will reference an article I found:\n\"Climate Change Takes Center Stage in Economics Departments\" by Lydia DePillis (LINK).\nThis article revolves around the growing interest in research related to climate change among\neconomists. The economists gathered at the Allied Social Sciences Association conferences to\ndiscuss the impacts of climate change on different sectors of the economy, ranging from natural\ndisasters to policy uncertainty. One issue highlighted is the economic burden stemming from\nuncertainty surrounding climate policies. This uncertainty has led to inefficient decision-making\nby individuals and firms as they require assistance in evaluating and adapting to the challenges\nposed by climate change. In the context of the situation, we are dealing with negative\nexternalities. Carbon emissions, contributing to climate change and a type of negative\nexternalities, impose significant costs on society through environmental pollution, health risks,\nand global warming. These costs are not entirely borne by fossil fuel producers and consumers\nbut are passed on to society. As a result, the market fails to internalize the negative externalities\nassociated with carbon emissions, leading to overconsumption of fossil fuels and further\nexacerbating climate change.\nPlease reach out to me if you have any further questions,\nY our Classmate\nWord Counts: 496\nReferences\nDepillis, L.

      "essay": "Hey there,\nI wanted to chat with you about market failure – a concept that’s really important in\nunderstanding economics! The general concept of Market failure is when the free market doesn’t\nuse its resources efficiently, which leads to issues like externalities, public goods, and\nmonopolies. In the article linked below this email, market failure is prevalent in the context of\nenvironmental regulations. The closure of older coal plants and the need for stringent on\nremaining facilities show that there is market failure due to externalities. Coal plants are unable\nto meet the air pollution requirements, which account for the negative impacts of pollution on the\npublic and environment. It’s important to note that this is a negative externality; the pollution that\nis being emitted from these industries, imposing costs on society that are not being reflected in\nthe prices of the goods that are being produced. In account, the EPA is taking measures to\nrepresent the market failure to promote a cleaner and healthier environment. Public goods can\nalso be used as an example because they are relevant in this article due to air quality regulation.\nClear air is considered a public good that benefits everyone in society. The issue is that coal\nplants and cement factories are polluting the air without considering the effects it has. A quote to\nfurther support the claim that this article illustrates a negative externality is “The closure of older\ncoal plants that were unable to meet existing air-pollution requirements, and the retrofitted plants\nthat remain in operation, highlight a situation where the costs of pollution emitted by these\nindustries are not fully internalized within the market dynamics. Consequently, the adverse\neffects on public health and the environment serve as clear examples of negative externalities\nresulting from industrial activities.” This quote helps prove that pollution emitted by the coal\nplants and industries impose costs on the environment, that is the cause of market failure.\nAnother quote as used in the article explains a negative externality that “\"EPA Administrator\nMichael Regan said soot pollution is a health problem for millions of Americans. 'The impact of\nthis pollution oftentimes disproportionately affects our most vulnerable communities, including\nlow-income communities, communities of color, children, older adults, and those who struggle\nwith heart or lung conditions,' Regan said Tuesday.\" This emphasizes that the impact of pollution\non demographic groups can create inequality and health imbalances in society.\nURL:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/epa-new-pollution-rule-coal-ecd553da\nWord Count: 408",

      "essay": "Hi my friend,\nI wanted to send you a message to update you on market failure using a recent real world example. In “We’re All Economics Now” a New York Times article by Lydia DePillis, she mentions how climate change is leading to market failure. Market failure is when the market is unable to reach the efficient outcome. When you have reached the efficient outcome that means you have maximized total surplus. From class we have learned that externalities and types of goods such as– public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods can lead to market failure. With externalities they can be either positive or negative. A positive externality produces an external benefit whereas a negative externally produces an external cost. An example of a positive externality could be vaccinations, because when enough people are vaccinated that limits the spread of the disease for everyone even those who aren't vaccinated. On the other hand, an example of a negative externality would be pollution because the polluter (the decision maker) has an effect on everyone's environment and the globe. \nIn order to reduce market failure the government can step in and intervene with externalities or the market for the good. The government can help the market reach efficiency by placing standards, taxes and trading permits on negative externalities. Placing taxes on negative externalities can discourage the activity and use of the good whereas when you subsidize a good you are encouraging that good.\nThe article points out a negative externality, of how climate change is affecting the economy and negatively affecting society as a whole. With the increase of carbon (leading to an overproduction of carbon in the atmosphere) economists talk about placing emission taxes and tradable emission permits in order to limit the tons of carbon. The idea is that the polluters will have to pay for the negative impact they are making on the environment and society. As well as incentivize them to stop producing as much carbon. \nAdditionally, the article talks about how economists and policy makers “perception has changed” (DePillis, 2024). Previously there was a production quota on how much carbon emissions can be produced as well as tradable permits. In recent years a new approach has emerged, there now are more incentives for not producing carbon emissions and rather using other cleaner energy sources for production (DePillis, 2024). This change in approach shows that policymakers, economists, and environmentalists are coming together to try to find new ways to encourage cleaner energy and reduce the impacts of climate change.\nUnderstanding and addressing these market failures is so important to promote economic efficiency and sustainability. Placing these taxes on the externalities can help make the world a more sustainable and better place. \n\nWord count: 455\nLink to article: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/economy/climate-change-economics.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nDePillis, L.

      "essay": "Dear friend:\nI wish you well. We have recently learned about the concept of ‘Market Failure’. The word describes a situation when the market equilibrium is no longer the most efficient. The cause of the market failure can vary from externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. I will focus on externality for the example. This means that while the producer and consumer of one market is trading goods, a third party is being affected by the actions. There can be positive and negative externalities.\nThe example I chose for you is from the new article titled: “North Carolina ‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N. Panel Says” . In the article, the reporter discussed how the repeated dumping of contaminated wastewater by a chemical plant on the Cape Fear River caused the water to be unsafe to drink for 100 miles. (Tabuchi, 2024) “We still have residents in our region who do not have access to clean, safe drinking water,” said Emily Donovan, co-founder of Clean Cape Fear(Tabuchi, 2024). Going back to the structure that I mentioned earlier, in this case, the citizens of the nearby area became the third party, suffering due to the negative externality of the factory. They were not involved in the cost that they need to face which is cleaning up the water in order to regain access to clean water again.\nLooking at the externality on the graph, a new line called social marginal cost was created above the X-axis under the original consumer and producer surplus with the equilibrium. We call the area between the social marginal cost and the x-axis the total external cost. While considering the total society surplus, we need to take into account the unwanted damage the market has done. In the article, this comes in the government imposing a pollution tax for the chemical plant. In order to visualize and calculate the society surplus better, we need to move the social marginal cost line above the supply line since it is a negative externality created by the producers. While it could seem that the total surplus of the producers is lower because of this, it only represents the society surplus and thus doesn’t mean a decrease in producer or consumer surplus. The previously mentioned inefficiency comes when we look at the graph of the market equilibrium price. Due to the additional external cost, a triangle above the equilibrium becomes the deadweight loss thus indicating that the market isn’t functioning at the maximum efficiency at the equilibrium. To calculate the society surplus, we need to subtract the deadweight loss from everything else. Right next to the deadweight loss triangle is the new intersection between the social marginal cost line and the unchanged demand line. At that line, no deadweight loss is seen which means it becomes the new efficiency point considering externality effects.\nSincerely,\nAn econ student\n\nCitations:\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “North Carolina ‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment #3\nMarket Failure is when the free market- without government intervention- fails to distribute\ngoods and services efficiently, which negatively impacts society. This can happen in many forms\nsuch as an externality, which is when the decisions and/or actions of an individual or company\naffect others who aren’t involved in that transaction. There are other failures in concepts such as\ncommon resources, artificially scarce goods, and public goods.\nTo explain further, I have an example from an article titled “Brazil’s Clashing Goals: Protect the\nAmazon and PumpLots More Oil,” which discusses the environmental conflicts in Brazil as there\nare plans to increase oil production within the country. Brazil previously had a great commitment\nto becoming more environmentally friendly to challenge climate change; however, Petrobras, the\nstate-run oil company, intends to increase oil production and potentially make Brazil the 3rd\nlargest producer of oil by 2030 (Bearak). This article (Source link: Bearak) in particular\nhighlights negative externalities, which occur when the production of a good harms a third party\nas I previously mentioned. That means that through the increase in oil production, there will be\nan increase in carbon emissions that negatively affect the environment, contributing further to\nclimate change, which is the opposite of the country's desires (Bearak). This is the cost that is not\ndirectly reflected in the price of oil.\nThe situation in Brazil demonstrates how the market when left by itself or in other words free,\nfails to account for environmental damage caused by fossil fuels with producing their good. This\nis a direct example of market failure as the market, in this case and others, fails to capture and\nacknowledge the full consequence and impact of oil production leading to further production and\nfurther harm. The article also provides an example of Common Resources because the\nenvironment and atmosphere are shared resources between consumers and producers, but are\nbeing depleted by the greenhouse emissions. There is no way to truly capture how much more\nthe atmosphere can absorb these toxic gases without further damage to the climate through\nglobal warming and climate change. Therefore, the harm done is almost finite. The atmosphere is\na resource overused through these emissions and that comes at a cost because of this, this\nrepresents a market failure because these producers are actively ignoring the true social and\nenvironmental cost of their oil.\nDespite the oil market's positive intentions and potential benefits such as “play[ing] a role in\nlessening the poverty dotting his vista (Bearak),” it’s not perfect. There are still underlined costs\nthat affect other parties, which is why this is a market failure. As a result, this is often handled by\nthe government in more ways than one to correct market failures. This includes a Pigouvian tax,\nsubsidy, or quota these are different ways the government tries to charge companies with the\nunintended cost of their production that they have either ignored or failed to account for.\nWord Count: 489\nWork Cited\nBearak, Max. “Brazil's Clashing Goals: Protect the Amazon and Pump Lots More Oil.” The New\nYork Times, 13 March 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/13/climate/brazil-oil-production.html.

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\n\nTo give you an update on what you missed, I will offer both an overview of market failure and an example of this from an article I recently read.\n\n Market failure occurs when the market does not reach the efficient outcome even if it’s in equilibrium, assuming that there is no intervention (Dudley). More precisely, this is a situation in which total surplus is not maximized due to any of the following: government intervention, an externality, or even the types of good. \n\nTo present a deeper dive into one of these, externalities are a common catalyst of market failure within the environment. For example, in the New York Times article attached below, Catrin Einhorn shows how the shift to alternative solar energy has actually caused a negative externality; since clean solar energy takes up so much space in farms, the surrounding wildlife has been hurt by this which is the root of the negative externality (Einhorn). Since the harm to wildlife has not been taken into account by the solar energy market, it is actually over supplied; the high external cost is not factored in by the producers, and therefore the costs are actually higher than the producers think. \n\nWhen creating the supply and demand graph that includes the external cost, we can use the social marginal cost, rather than the private marginal cost (typical supply graph), that includes both the private marginal cost and the external cost that society pays by producing one additional unit of that product. To relate this back to our example in the article, the private marginal cost would be the supply schedule of solar farm producers. When you add the fact that wildlife is being harmed, the external cost that society pays for an additional solar farm is actually higher than the supplier realizes. Because of this, the social marginal cost is higher than the private marginal cost. However, a negative externality is commonly present in which the producer fails to realize that their production is causing harm, so the market still operates at the equilibrium of where private marginal cost and private marginal benefit intersect. This leads to the deadweight loss in the market because the efficient price is where social marginal cost equals the social marginal benefit since total surplus would be maximized. \n\nAs a result of  market failure, there are ways to work towards efficiency. For example, government standards, taxes, production quotas, and permits may all be required in order to account for the externality. In the case of the solar panels’ harm to wildlife, Einhorn mentions how producers are starting to notice that change is necessary. They may have to renovate the fencing to protect the wildlife, which would cost more money to the producer, inching closer to the social marginal cost. In the future, producers of solar farms will have to account for the tradeoff of wildlife and energy, but investors and governments may look to increase regulations to account for the externality (Einhorn).\n\nI hope this helped!\n\nBest,\nYour Friend\n(499 Words)\nWorks Cited\n\nDudley, Mitchell. \"Externalities.\" 22 Feb. 2024.

      "essay": "To: My friend\nFrom: Your friend\n\nDear friend,\n\nMarket failure occurs when, absent any government involvement, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome. In turn, the market is also failing to maximize total surplus and creates deadweight loss. Thus, society is not benefiting as much as it could be. \nThe several factors that can lead to market failure are common resources, public goods, artificially scarce goods, and externalities. Externalities occur when a third party, who has no control or choice, is impacted by the decisions made in a market. There are two types of externalities: negative and positive. Positive externalities are benefits that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation, whereas negative externalities are uncompensated costs, also known as external costs, that an individual or firm imposes on others. With negative externalities, the third party is being harmed. \nSince producers fail to recognize the external cost, the supply curve solely represents the price it takes for them to produce a good. Thus, the supply curve represents the producer’s marginal cost. To represent the producer’s marginal cost and the external cost, or the external marginal cost, a third curve is formed. This curve, which is in addition to the traditional supply and demand curve, is known as the social marginal cost curve. For a market to operate at the efficient outcome with a negative externality, it should be operating at the point that the demand curve intersects the social marginal cost curve. \nIn the United States, the energy sector is facing significant challenges as it confronts the need to reduce air pollution, specifically from fine particulate matter (PM2.5). This pollution, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, is contributing to serious environmental and health issues, including respiratory problems and heart disease. Despite the clear negative externality of PM2.5 emissions, the industry has been slow to adapt to cleaner technologies, leading to overproduction of pollution and an inefficient market outcome, characterized by significant deadweight loss.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is stepping in to correct this market failure by proposing stricter limits on PM2.5 emissions. However, instead of directly addressing the externality through mechanisms like emissions trading or taxes, the proposed regulations focus on setting specific performance standards for emissions reductions. This approach has sparked opposition from within the industry, which argues that the new standards will impose heavy costs and could lead to job losses, particularly in manufacturing sectors that are already under economic pressure.\nA potentially more efficient solution could involve the implementation of a market-based mechanism, such as a cap-and-trade system for PM2.5 emissions. This would directly target the pollution externality by creating a financial incentive for companies to reduce emissions, aligning the private cost of pollution with its social cost. Such a system could mitigate the deadweight loss by encouraging innovation and adaptation in the sector, ultimately leading to a reduction in PM2.5 emissions without imposing undue economic burdens on the industry.\n\nI hope this helped!\nBest,\nYour friend\n\nWord Count: 486\n\n",

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nMarket failure can be a tricky topic to understand. In economics market failure is\ncharacterized by the inefficiency of allocating goods and services in the free market, which leads to\ndeadweight losses and suboptimal outcomes for society. Essentially, the market produces either too\nlittle or too much of certain goods or services at the equilibrium price in the free market. There are a\nmultitude of reasons why the market fails. The ones to focus on are externalities, common resources,\npublic goods, and artificially scarce goods. A good example of a positive externality is vaccines,\nwhere the benefit of having more people vaccinated is very positive for society. The equilibrium\npoint is producing too few vaccinated people for herd immunity due to the cost compared to the\nefficient point of the number of vaccinated people. In contrast to that a negative externality is where\na producer produces too much of a good that has a negative impact on society. A good example of\nthis would be smoking where the equilibrium point of smoking is too high since smoking can be\nharmful to many people and needs to be cut back. Common resources and public goods can be\ngrouped together where common resources and public goods are accessible, however common\nresources are rivals in consumption meaning the use of this good diminishes the opportunity for\nothers to use it, while public goods are non-rivalrous and the consumption doesn’t interfere with\nothers use of the good. These types of goods are market failures since the correct allocation cannot\nbe made without government intervention.\nAn artificially scarce good is a good or service that is excludable, not a necessity, but is\nnonrivalrous. An example of an artificially scarce good playing a factor in market failure is shown\nin the article Love streaming on prime? Amazon will now force you to watch ads, unless you pay\nmore by Kelly Lawler. In the article it talks about how amazon prime which offered no ads while\nstreaming previously, is planning on implementing a membership for $2.99 more a month for no ads\nwhile the regular membership which would still cost $14.99 would have ads. The implementation of\nthese ads introduces inconvenience to consumers or an artificial layer of scarcity. Most often then\nnot, these streaming services are one product for people. There is minimal to no marginal cost for the\nproducers while they still charge a high price for the service. The appeal for no ads attracts people to\nthe service. Adding ads and charging more for no ads creates a tier subscription system making a\nlevel of artificial scarcity as people are forced to either pay more or watch ads. Therefore some\npeople may be forced to leave or pay more for the one service,which isn’t efficient.\nAddressing these market failures is therefore crucial for an efficient market.\n-Y our Friend\nWords: 475(excluding “Hi friend” and “Y our Friend”)\nLawler, K.

      "essay": "3/24/24\nDear friend,\nSince you had to leave campus for a family emergency, I am authoring this email to you in\norder to catch you up on the concept of a market failure. In simple terms a market failure\noccurs when goods are not being efficiently allocated within the market with the condition\nof it being a free market. In a functioning free market, the balance between demand and\nsupply shifts and changes to keep the market at equilibrium. A market failure occurs when\nan extra force throws the market off balance, and it is unable to regulate itself. Public\ngoods, common resources, artificially scarce goods, negative externalities, and more\ntypes of forces can tip a free market off kilter and result in a struggle to find ways to\nefficiently allocate their goods. This article posted to the New York Times may help clear up\nwhat a market failure is and how it transpires in the world. Microplastics are a Big Problem,\na New Film Warns, is an article written by Andrew Jacobs that illustrates how microplastics\nhave been produced by factories for the past five decades which has led to an abundance\nof them polluting our earth and our bodies. 400 million tons of plastic is churned out by\nthese companies yearly and experts estimate that most of this residual plastic will be\nbroken down into tiny specks creating microplastics that will infect our ecosystems and\nour bodies. Microplastics are being found embedded into our ecosystems, blood, lungs,\nbrains, and even the placentas of mothers (Jacobs). This article represents a market failure\ndue to a negative externality, microplastics. A negative externality is when there is a\nbyproduct poorly affecting a third group of people as result of the production of these\nproducts. The factories are part of the market because they produce goods that overtime\nwill result in microplastics as a consequence of weathering. Therefore, the market is\ncreating a negative effect harming a third group outside of the market's consumers. This\nthird group being the earth and all humans that are becoming sick or are ingesting this\npollution unknowingly. The reason a negative externality can result in a market failure is\nbecause the negative third party’s surplus will lower the total consumer surplus and cause\nthe market to lose consumers or revenue which means their resources are not being\nefficiently allocated in this market. Most types of market failures are usually resolved by\nsome sort of government involvement whether that be a law, policy, subsidy, or tax on the\nmarket that is resulting in this extremely negative by product. In the case of a pollutant the\ngovernment would enforce regulations or policies in order to bring the market back\ntowards equilibrium by decreasing the effect of the negative externality.\nBest,\nYour friend\nWord count: 458\nResources\nJacobs, Andrew.

      "essay": "Dear friend, \nI hope all is well at home– sending my best wishes! \nFor an overview, market failure describes an inefficient allocation of goods because it does not account for an external cost or benefit in the decision-making process: the market equilibrium is not equal to the efficient price and quantity. For example, a private marginal cost, accounting for these external conditions, becomes the social marginal cost curve. Because the private marginal benefit curve remains the same, the shift provides a new point that gives the efficient price and quantity for the given good. If the cost in this scenario were on an unrelated third-party, it would be considered a negative externality where there the market activity is too high. Vice-versa, the market activity is too low and is considered a positive externality. \nIn addition to the externalities stated above, the type of goods being demanded can also determine the potential for a market failure. The characteristics, excludability and rivalry in consumption, dictate the category of the good (Dudley, 5). Excludability is if the consumption of the good is determined by an enforceable payment; rivalry in consumption is if one’s utilization impedes another’s ability to consume the same good. Private goods (excludable and rival in consumption) are the only category capable of achieving market efficiency without government intervention. Artificially scarce goods (excludable and nonrival in consumption), common resources (non-excludable and rival in consumption), and public goods (excludable and nonrival in consumption) are all designated as market failures and need the government to place an artificially cost to produce an efficient outcome. \nThe New York Times article– “Many Laws to Protect Sharks Have Backfired, Researcher Find”– shows the consequences of a common resource market failure today. In the late 1900s, countries enforced legislation in an attempt to prevent shark finning (a practice of removing the fins and discarding the carcasses into the water). These new laws forced fishers to land the fish whole. Unexpectedly, this led to an increase in demand for shark meat, resulting in further species endangerment due to the increasing consequence disregardment. \nAs a common resource (non-excludable and rival in consumption), there is no payment associated with landing a shark but catching it prevents others from consuming that same shark. Fishers tend to land as many individuals as possible because there is no guarantee the population will exist tomorrow. As a result, the social marginal cost is greater than the private marginal cost– the current market equilibrium is greater than efficiency (Dudley, 11). \nThis results in “a tragedy of the commons” scenario– the overexploitation of a common resource threatens extinction for said population. The approaches of government intervention in the form of tradable licenses for access to the sharks would be most effective (Dudley, 12). Property rights or Pigouvian taxes could also be established, but there would likely be more diversity among these because of the different nations creating legislation. \nI hope this helps with understanding the concept of market failures.

      "essay": "Hello,\nI heard you were struggling with the concept of market failure, I believe I can help you\nunderstand the topic better.\nMarket failure occurs when a market doesn’t live up to the standards of perfect\ncompetition, which would lead to an efficient distribution of goods/services at the optimal price\nand quantity. A market fails when total surplus isn’t maximized. Market failure can occur when\nstructural failures in the market include non-private goods and externalities. To give context,\nnon-private goods include public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce resources.\nEssentially, the inherent nature of these goods leads to the market not utilizing them efficiently,\nand thus, market failure occurs within the market. Externalities, economic side effects, or\nby-products that affect an uninvolved third party, can be negative or positive. Negative\nexternalities are uncompensated costs that an individual/firm imposes on others; positive\nexternalities are benefits that an individual/firm confers on others without receiving\ncompensation. Both cause inefficiencies which means there is deadweight loss in the market.\nA news article from the Wall Street Journal, published on March 7th, 2024, titled\n“Biotech VCs See Room for More Growth in Obesity Drug Market.” presents a situation of an\nartificially scarce good, leading to market failure. Essentially, the demand for obesity medication\nhas increased due to high obesity rates. While the high demand for this good is evident, there’s\nlimited availability of the good because pharmaceutical companies don’t have enough\ninformation to figure out the risks and benefits of various obesity treatments, making it difficult\nto distribute the medicine. This causes the good to be artificially scarce because the drug is\nexcludable (the supplier can prevent individuals from consuming it if they do not pay) and\nnon-rival (the consumption of the good by an individual does not reduce the amount available for\nothers). The market failure lies in the inadequate distribution of this drug despite this clear\ndemand, signaling inefficiencies in the pharmaceutical market. This relates to artificially scarce\ngoods because the limited availability of obesity treatments contrasts with the stark demand,\nmaking the drug scarce. Because the supply of the drug is limited, the competition for it\nincreases, driving prices high. In addition, many companies are profiting immensely off of these\ndrugs allowing resources to be diverted to profit-seeking endeavors instead of the distribution of\nthe obesity drug. As seen in the article, due to the large market “the motivation is there for any\npharma that’s in it to maintain their leadership.” (Gormley). This contributes to why the supply is\nlimited because the pharmaceutical companies want to maintain their dominance in the market to\nmaximize their profits. This leads to maneuvers that ultimately restrict competition. Also,\nregulatory hurdles and complex manufacturing practices make it challenging for new entrants to\nenter the market and increase overall supply. These points show why the supply is being\nrestricted while the price remains high. This article presents a topic showcasing a market failure\nthrough artificially scarce goods.\nHope this helps!\nArticle Link: Biotech VCs See Room for More Growth in Obesity Drug Market - WSJ\nWord Count: 496\nWork Cited\nGormely, Brain.

Market failure occurs when,\nabsent any government intervention, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome, where total\nsurplus is maximized, even when the market is in equilibrium, where supply and demand\nintersect. This means that the market fails to maximize total surplus and intersect at the social\nmarginal benefit and marginal cost: therefore is not efficient. A few ways market failure can\nhappen is through externalities, common goods, artificially scarce goods, and public goods.\nNegative Externalities, a specific form of market failure, are uncompensated costs that a third\nparty imposes on the supply and demand market. This article, E.P .A. Sets Limits on Carcinogenic\nGas Used to Sterilize Medical Devices, is an example of how pollution, a negative externality, can\ncause damage to human health and the medical device and healthcare market, causing market\nfailure.\nThis article is about how the gas used in sterilizing medical equipment, ethylene oxide,\ncan cause cancer and damage to the nervous and reproductive systems to the townspeople who\nlive around the sterilizing plants. The fact that this gas is polluting nearby towns and causing\nmajor health issues to the residents makes the gas a negative externality, and forces the supply of\nthis gas to be reduced.\nThe healthcare market is barred from maximizing total surplus due to the shortage of\nsterile medical equipment. Due to the health issues, the EPA has put restrictions on the emission\nof this sterilizing gas, which will decrease the supply of sterile devices. If there is a shortage of\nsterile devices and the demand is not met, many people risk death or excessive injury without\nclean, correct medical help. Since ethylene oxide is the only effective sterilizer on the market\ncurrently, it will be costly and take much time for a solution to be balanced between the health of\nthese towns and access to sterile medical equipment. This means that in the period between\nlimiting the use of ethylene oxide and finding an effective replacement, there will be a massive\nshortage of supply, shifting the market to the left and away from efficiency. Also, with the\nincreased health issues from the gas, the rise in demand for healthcare in these towns will create\na strain on the healthcare system as there will be a shortage of laborers and equipment. The\nmarket failure involved with this issue is a shortage of sterile medical equipment from a quota\nbeing put on the use of ethylene oxide. Because the EPA is limiting the amount of ethylene oxide\nthat can be used, there will be less medical equipment than the current market quantity, causing a\ndrastic shortage and lack of efficiency.\nThe harm from ethylene oxide, a third party, caused harm to the medical market, making\nit a negative externality, and the negative effects the externality has on supply creates market\nfailure.\nI hope this helps!\n- Y our Classmate.\nWorks Cited\nFriedman, Lisa. “E.P .A.

      "essay": "Dear friend in Econ 101,\nI understand that you have been struggling with the concept of market failure. A recent concept that has been talked about is efficiency in the market: When total surplus is completely maximized this is an efficient market. However, when total surplus is not maximized we experience market failure, because when something is preventing a market from being in equilibrium, this is inefficient, thus it is a market failure. Some examples you most likely understand are taxes and quotas as they create limits on goods, causing inefficiency, which is a failure in the market. Some newer concepts you might need help with are types of goods and externalities. \n\tTypes of goods depend on whether the good is excludable and a rival in consumption. Excludable means the producer can charge people for that good and those who do not pay cannot consume the good. A rival in consumption is a good that cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time. A private good will be both excludable and a rival in consumption, an example of this being food items or anything you need to purchase that only you can consume. Private goods are most efficient when at market equilibrium because consumer surplus and producer surplus are most maximized at equilibrium with a private good.\n\tThese types of goods can all be efficient in the market however many goods create externalities. Externalities are the consequences that a good has on a third party (neither consumers/producers) that create inefficiency in the market, thus externalities cause market failures. There are both positive and negative externalities. Goods that cause pollution or ruin the value of a property are negative externalities because they have an external cost that affects society negatively. Because of this, there is a total external cost that shifts price and quantity, to maximize consumer and producer surpluses, and in this process it creates deadweight loss, resulting in market failure. On the other hand, a positive externality is a benefit to society, so goods that reduce pollution or improve the health of society are examples of positive externalities. This positive externality also results in inefficiency because the total external benefit of this good shifts the price and quantity of the good resulting in less external benefit than what there could be.\n\tA current example of a negative externality happening right now is Stanley Tumbler mugs, a private good. Stanley tumbler mugs are both excludable and a rival in consumption, and because of this, they would function most efficiently in the market at the equilibrium price and quantity. The problem with these mugs is that they use non-renewable resources which are causing more pollution to be emitted into the environment. This pollution creates an external cost that will force producers of this mug to increase the price and decrease the quantity being sold of these mugs (Hiroko, New York Times).\n\nHopefully I was able to assist you in any troubles,\nA fellow Econ 101 student\nWord count: 497\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Is There a Climate Cost to Collecting Climate-Friendly Stuff, like Mugs?” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Feb. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/climate/stanley-mug-sustainability.html.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Good morning Jenna,\nI hope everything is going well for you regarding your family! I understand that the\nmaterial may seem overwhelming right now, but hopefully, my explanation will help you\nunderstand it better. Let’s begin by briefly unwrapping the general concept of market failure.\nBefore we dive into market failure immediately, let’s start with an explanation of externalities,\nwhich will tie into market failure once we go over an example. In the lecture, Professor Dudley\nexplained that there are 2 types of externalities; negative and positive. A negative externality is\nessentially an unexpected third party that faces a cost in a process. For example, production\ncould cause smoke from the exhaust to enter the atmosphere and cause acid rain, killing trees\n(which would be the third party). A positive externality would be the opposite of this and is a\nbenefit that an individual puts on an unrelated group without any cost. An example would be\nonly needing 75% of the population vaccinated to stop a spread completely. So how does this tie\ninto market failure? We can start by asking ourselves how we know externalities cause a market\nfailure. The steps you could follow to measure a market’s failure would be to first identify the\ntotal surplus at the market equilibrium. The total surplus would indicate who is part of society,\nwhich would be consumers, producers, and the 3rd party harmed, or benefitted, by the\nexternality. A market could fail by interventions, and when the market doesn’t maximize the total\nsurplus, even in the equilibrium. A real-life example I thought might help you understand it fully\nwas a New Y ork Times article I found about the negative impact of plastic in the production of\nhousehold items. The report explained that although the usage of plastic products has helped\nimprove everyday life, there is a problem lying in the fact that they are rarely recycled. The\nplastic that remains unused gets broken down by the sunlight, wind, and sea into particles called\nmicroplastics. First found in ocean habitats, scientists have also been finding them in places like\nmountain peaks, ocean floors, and in the seafood we eat. Microplastics have also recently been\ndiscovered in the human body, in our lungs, blood, and breast milk, which is especially\nconcerning as it gets shared with infants. More and more health risks are being discovered\nresulting from plastic pollution, and we can use this as a prime example of market failure. What\nwould be identified as a market failure would be the unexpected third party that the production of\nplastic products attracts as we mentioned earlier. Because the production of plastic goods harms\nthe third party, this would be considered a negative externality, and an inefficient market.

      "essay": "To: Friend\nFrom: Econ Student\nSubject: Market Failure\n\nHi Friend, \n   A market failure is when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even in equilibrium, absent any intervention. This means the market does not maximize total surplus. Market failure can be measured through three steps. First, identity the total surplus at equilibrium. Second, identify the total surplus at the efficient outcome. Efficiency is where the maximum total surplus exists, and total surplus is society’s net gain from the market. Society’s total net gain is maximized where marginal benefit intersects marginal cost, so this intersection represents the efficient outcome. Finally, measure the difference between the efficient outcome and equilibrium outcome, which is the deadweight loss, and the level of market failure.  \n  Externalities are an example of market failure. There are two types of externalities: negative and positive. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on an unrelated third party. This third party is not the buyer or seller of the good but is negatively affected through its production or consumption. When a negative externality exists, the market overproduces as it does not account for the external cost, and the efficient quantity will be less than the equilibrium quantity. A positive externality is a benefit an individual or firm confers on the unrelated third party, without any compensation. The third party is positively affected through the production or consumption of the good. When a positive externality exists, the market underproduces as it does not consider the external benefit it is providing and could create more surplus if it considered the benefit. In both cases, market equilibrium fails to account for the externality and does not generate as much total surplus as is possible, so the market is not efficient.  \n  An example of a negative externality is pollution caused by petrochemical plants in Texas and Louisiana (“United States”). The plants are owned by corporations like Shell and ExxonMobil and produce chemicals that are sold to domestic and international consumers to create plastics and pesticides. The plants have exceeded air pollution limits, and the air and water pollution the plants create have caused widespread chronic health issues, like lung cancer, in the communities near the plants (“United States”). The average life expectancy is up to 20 years lower in communities closer to the plants than in communities 15 miles further away (“United States”). This is an example of a negative externality. Pollution is an uncompensated cost that the petrochemical companies are imposing on nearby residents. The residents are uninvolved with the production or consumption of chemicals, yet the firms are placing an external cost of pollution and health issues on these communities. The Coase Theorem states that the market may be able to internalize the externality, but only if the transaction costs are sufficiently low, which is rare. However, the government may intervene by engaging with the externality directly, the pollution, or by engaging with associated market for the good, the petrochemical market. The government could implement stricter environmental standards, emissions taxes, or tradable emissions permits to reduce the negative externality. \n\nBest,\nEcon Student \n\n\nWord Count: 498 \n\nWork Cited\n“United States: Lives Devastated and Human Rights Sacrificed by Fossil Fuel-Related Pollution from Petrochemical Plants in Texas and Louisiana.” Amnesty International, 25 Jan. 2024, www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/01/united-states-lives-devastated-and-human-rights-sacrificed-by-toxic-fossil-fuel-related-pollution-from-petrochemical-plants-in-texas-and-louisiana/.\n\n",

I'm here to help you understand the\nconcept of market failure, which can be tricky to grasp at first. I'm confident we can clear it up\ntogether.\nMarket failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is inefficient,\nleading to an outcome that is not socially optimal. In simpler terms, it's when the market doesn't\nwork as it should. One common cause of market failure is the existence of externalities, which\nare costs or benefits that affect parties who do not choose to incur them.\nA recent article from The Washington Post titled \"What climate scientists are predicting for the\nglobe in 2024\" discusses predictions made by climate scientists regarding global temperatures in\n2024. It points out that factors such as the El Niño climate pattern, record-high ocean\ntemperatures, and the potential for exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels\ncontribute to the scenario.\nThe market failure highlighted in this article revolves around negative externalities caused by\ngreenhouse gas emissions. When businesses and individuals engage in economic activities like\nburning fossil fuels, they emit greenhouse gasses. These emissions contribute to global warming,\nleading to climate change impacts such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea\nlevel rise. However, the emitters do not accept the costs associated with these impacts; instead,\nthey are externalized onto society.\nFor example, the article mentions record-high ocean temperatures, which can devastate marine\necosystems and coastal communities. These consequences impose significant costs on society in\nterms of damage to fisheries, loss of biodiversity, and increased risk of natural disasters. Yet,\nthose responsible for greenhouse gas emissions do not directly bear these costs, creating a market\nfailure situation where the actual social cost of carbon emissions is not reflected in the market\nprice of fossil fuels.\nIn economic terms, the market for fossil fuels fails to internalize the total costs of production and\nconsumption, leading to overconsumption and overproduction of these goods. As a result, we see\na misallocation of resources, with too much emphasis on activities that generate greenhouse gas\nemissions and too little attention paid to cleaner, renewable alternatives.\nTherefore, this article demonstrates how market failure, particularly in the form of negative\nexternalities, leads to inefficient outcomes and the exacerbation of climate change.\nUnderstanding this concept is crucial as it helps us recognize when and why markets don't\noperate optimally, prompting the need for government intervention or policy measures to correct\nthese inefficiencies.\nThis example helps clarify the concept of market failure for you. If you have any questions or\nneed further explanation, please don't hesitate to reach out.\nBest,\nYour Friend\nWord Count: [445]\nWork Cited\nDance, Scott. “What Climate Scientists Are Predicting for the Globe in 2024 - ...” The\nWashington Post, 2 Jan. 2024,\nwww.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/02/record-heat-2024-el-nino/.",

This efficient outcome represents the price and quantity at which\ntotal surplus, the overall economic benefit from the distribution of resources, is maximized.\nHowever, despite the self-regulating nature of markets, there are instances where they fail to\nachieve this optimal outcome, resulting in what economists term as market failure. This failure to\nefficiently allocate resources can arise due to various factors and can lead to inefficiencies and\nwelfare losses for society.\nThe article, “The East Coast Is Sinking” by Mira Rojanasakul and Marco Hernandez,\npublished by the New Y ork Times is a clear example of market failure. It highlights the\nmisallocation and overuse of groundwater along the east coast and the resulting harmful effects\nlike land subsidence which exacerbates the negative effects of rising sea levels.\nA primary cause of this market’s failure is an externality. Externalities are\nuncompensated benefits or costs an individual or firm imposes on third parties not involved in\nthe market transaction. When groundwater is pumped out, aquifers deplete and soil compresses\n2\ncausing the land to sink. This, paired with rising sea levels, harms neighboring landowners,\ngovernmental agencies, and communities by increasing their vulnerability to floods and storm\nsurges, causing structural damage, etc. Because the consumers and producers within the market\ndo not bear the full costs, there’s no incentive to reduce the quantity pumped resulting in\noverproduction\nFurthermore, the type of goods being traded can result in market failure. Groundwater is\na common good This means it is non-excludable (a price cannot be attached that limits access to\nthe good to those who pay) so it is often overused and depleted. It’s also a rival (the same unit of\nthe good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time) which means the\nindividual/private cost that market interactions are based on is lower than the social marginal\ncost.\nThe negative externality associated with groundwater pumping, combined with its status\nas a common good, contributes to the market failure described by Rojanasakul and Hernandez in\nthe article.\nIt is important to understand and recognize market failures because it reveals situations\nwhere the market outcome is not the most efficient outcome and government intervention\nthrough taxes, quotas, new standards, or subsidies may be applied to shift the market to an\nefficient outcome.\nI hope this email helped explain the topics you missed in class, let me know if I can help\nwith anything else!\nSee you soon,\nY our Friend\n3\n(Word count: 458)\nWorks Cited\nRojanasakul, Mira, and Marco Hernandez. “From NYC to Miami, Major Cities Along the East\nCoast are Sinking.” The New York Times, 23 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/13/climate/flooding-sea-levels-groundwater.html?\naction=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-climate&variant=show®ion\n=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc.",

      "essay": "Subject: Explaining Market Failure\nHey Friend,\nI know you have been struggling with the concept of Market Failure, so I just wanted to help out\na bit.\nFirst, a market failure can be defined as an inefficient distribution of goods and services in a\nmarket with no outside government intervention (Drury). In class, we learned of the following\nfour different market failures: Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially\nScarce Goods.\nTo better understand market failure, I included an article that represents one of the market\nfailures we learned in class-—externalities. There are two types of externalities—positive and\nnegative. A positive externality is a benefit that an individual or corporation grants to others,\nsuch as a flu vaccine, making those without the vaccine less susceptible to contracting the flu. A\nnegative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or corporation places on others,\nsuch as the effects of a factory’s pollution on neighboring town residents (Dudley).\nIn the Wall Street Journal article, “If Y ou’re Buying a Home Near a Nightmare Neighbor, Y ou\nMight Want to Think Again”, various real estate agents recount the times neighbors made the\nsale of the properties difficult by interrupting showings, screaming at potential buyers, etc.\nSpecifically, in the article, one agent recounts that even after managing to sell a property, the\nneighbor would turn off the utilities of the buyer, causing countless lawsuits between the\nprevious owner for not disclosing the adverse conditions of the living by the neighbor. If the\nprevious owner had mentioned these conditions, the property would not have been sold at the\nprice it was valued in the market or as quickly.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nBased on a news article I recently read titled, \"Indonesia’s Vote: Three Takeaways for Climate Change,\" I’m better able to explain the idea of market failure. To start, let me give you the bare definition followed by a detailed description through the use of this news article combined with my current economic knowledge. A market failure is when a market is in equilibrium, however, the total surplus isn’t maximized, making it an inefficient market/market failure. A market failure can occur from different issues, but this article focuses on a market failure through a negative externality: a negative impact to a third party (not a producer or consumer), representing a cost to society causing the market to fail.\nFor some context about this article, President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto has vowed to transition to a more environmentally friendly state, by starting to build EV factories, stimulating the market for nickel mining. Although this change in the long term will cause Indonesia to be more climate-friendly, in the short term, its carbon footprint will skyrocket. Moreover, the mining of nickel and the creation of EV factories have caused a mass output of carbon, which has “violated the rights of Indigenous communities and caused water and air pollution”.\nThe nickel mining market and EV factory building market impact a third party, which are the communities impacted by pollution, by polluting the air they breathe and water they drink. Because this is a negative impact to a third party, it is a cost that isn’t accounted for within Indonesian society within the market of these goods; To be accounted for, this external cost is added to the cost to supply the goods in the respective markets. But, in reality this doesn’t happen: people will consume/produce without the impact in mind causing the market equilibrium to be at a quantity in which there is too much.\n\nMore specifically, Indonesia is building too many factories and consuming more nickel than it should be. Now we call this a market failure because the total surplus in the current equilibrium is less than the total surplus for the efficient quantity of these markets, which is represented by the quantity of transactions if the cost to society were accounted for (it would be less because people understand the impacts of pollution therefore consuming less). For equilibrium quantity, the total surplus is measured by the consumer and minus the unaccounted for cost to society. Next, the efficient quantity is just measured by consumer/producer surplus. Even though there is a slight consumer/producer loss at efficiency (because of lower transactions), the cost of society in equilibrium outweighs this, making total surplus lower in equilibrium than at the efficient quantity. Overall, because the market for EV factories/nickel mining externally impacts society negatively through pollution, its total surplus at equilibrium isn’t maximized: these markets are inefficient and are considered a failure. I hope this better helps you understand the idea of market failure given this specific type.\nWord count:500\n",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\n\n\tMarket failure is defined as when the market inefficiently allocates goods and services (Investopedia). Specifically, this occurs when the efficient market quantity differs from the socially efficient quantity, which is defined at the point where the marginal social cost is equal to the marginal social benefit. The marginal social cost is a combination of the producer’s marginal cost and the total external cost of the good or service. On the other hand, the marginal social benefit is a combination of the consumer’s marginal benefit and the total external cost. There are a multitude of ways market failure can occur, the first being externalities. In a positive externality, the market is not maximizing marginal social benefit by producing too few goods/services, while in a negative externality, the market is not minimizing the marginal social cost as it produces too many goods and services. The government can step in and help solve these externalities. To solve positive externalities, governments can issue subsidies to boost the production of goods/services. In the case of negative externalities, governments can implement Pigouvian taxes, environmental policies, and tradeable emission permits to limit the total amount of goods/services produced. Different types of goods also contribute to market failure. Since common goods are rivals in consumption, but they are non-excludable, the marginal social marginal cost tends to be higher than the producer’s marginal cost. Since public goods are both non-rival in consumption and non-excludable, anyone has access to these goods and will experience the benefit at no cost, this is known as the free-rider problem. Finally, artificially scarce goods are excludable, however, they are non-rival in consumption, which means the efficient market quantity is lower than the socially efficient quantity. For example, let’s take a look at this article I found in the New York Times, in which cities across the globe have been joining the Plant-Based Treaty – a global initiative to reduce meat and dairy consumption. This treaty is representative of a positive externality. There are external benefits associated with the consumption of plant-based meats, specifically, seen in how it reduces greenhouse gas emissions from food production as studies have shown how vegan diets result in 75% fewer greenhouse gas emissions (Buckley). These external effects result in the marginal social benefit being higher than the market quantity, as the market price doesn’t reflect these benefits. There are a few ways that the government can step in to solve this externality. First and foremost, they can implement environmental incentives for farmers to adopt sustainable practices or educational campaigns to increase awareness about the benefits of plant-based diets, to boost the sale of these goods. Another government action could be a subsidy for farmers to transition from conventional food production to organic plant-based farming. This will lead to more consumption of the product, which will correct the MSB and MB alignment, making them equal, as the price will then take into account the external benefits. Let me know if you have any more questions about market failures!\nThanks\n\nWord Count: 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nBuckley, Cara. “These Cities Aren’t Banning Meat.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI’m sorry about your family emergency, however I hope that I will be helpful in your\nunderstanding of market failure.\nMarket failure is an economic term that refers to when the market is inefficient, or the amount of\ngoods and services demanded by consumers does not meet the amount supplied. Market failure\ncan lead to many negative consequences, including a misallocation of resources and welfare loss.\nSome reasons for a market to fail include externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods. Public goods are non-excludable and non-rival, meaning that they are\nunderproduced; common resources are non-excludable and non-rival, meaning that they are\ntypically overused. Artificially scarce goods are excludable and non-rival, leading to a\nmisallocation of resources.\nAn example that we are going to focus on involves a negative externality. As a reminder, an\nexternality in economics refers to the benefits or consequences of a specific economic activity\nfor a third party that is not involved in the market. The consequences for the third party involved\nin a negative externality can be illustrated as a social marginal cost. The intersection between the\nsocial marginal cost and the supply is the efficient quantity. Since the real market equilibrium\ndoes not intersect at this point, rather it intersects where supply and demand meet, this means\nthat the market is inefficient and therefore there is a market failure present.\nAn example of a market failure in recent news is the influx of private planes flying to the\nsuperbowl in Las V egas. Around 1,000 aircrafts were expected to land at the Las V egas airport,\nincluding one carrying Taylor Swift from Tokyo. These private aircrafts release significant\namounts of greenhouse gas emissions, which result in smog and pollution issues for everyone,\nincluding those not involved in private air travel. As a result of the increase in demand for\nprivate air travel due to the Superbowl, there will be an increase in pollution. This smog and\npollution can be identified as negative externalities for locals who are not participating in private\nair travel. This means that the emissions from the private planes are a social marginal cost to\nsociety, and will affect a third party not involved in the market. This is a direct example of a\nnegative externality as well as a market failure.\nI hope that this explanation helped you to understand market failure and how negative\nexternalities affect a third party.\nBest wishes,\nY our classmate\nNarciso, G.

      "essay": "Jett Adler\nEcon 101\n03/25/24\nWriting Assignment 3\nDear friend,\nI hope all is well with you and your family. Market failure occurs when resources are\nallocated efficiently in the market. A market failure typically leads to a loss in economic and\nsocial value. It is essential to understand that a market failure does not mean that the market\nfailed in eternity; it is just not performing at maximum efficiency, leading to a loss in overall\nwelfare. This inefficiency can be attributed to externalities, public goods(non-excludable and\nnonrival in consumption), artificially scarce goods(excludable and nonrival), or common\nresources(non-excludable but rival). A good being excludable means that if someone has not\npaid for a good, they can be prevented from using it. Rivalry in consumption simply means that\nif one person is using the good, that good is no longer accessible to others. A service like Spotify\nis an example of an artificially scarce good because in order to use it, you must pay for the\nsubscription, and when you choose to listen to a song, it doesn't prevent others from listening to\nthe same music as well. There are two types of externalities: positive and negative. A negative\nexternality is the indirect harm to a 3rd party, for example, getting secondhand smoke. A positive\nexternality is an indirect benefit to a 3rd party; for example, getting vaccinated reduces the risk\nfor others because they can no longer get the sickness from you. In order to solve this\ninefficiency, the government has to intervene in the market to correct failures.\nAn excellent example of a market failure happening in real life is forever\nchemicals(PFAs) getting into the water supply because of their use in fast food wrappers.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the FDA has urged all fast food companies to stop the use of\nPFAs in their food wrappers because when these wrappers decompose, they leave behind these\nPFAs, which then get into our water supply(Amenabar). This pollution is an example of a\nnegative externality because when the PFAs get into the water supply, it has a negative impact on\neveryone who drinks the water, even if they didn't buy the fast food. The social marginal cost of\ncontinuing to produce these food wrappers is too great, considering that consuming a minimal\namount of PFAs can be very harmful to the body, so the government had to step in to reduce the\nuse of these wrappers. If the government were to ban the use of these high PFA wrappers and\nrequire companies to use a more environmentally friendly wrapper, then this negative cost to\nsociety would be eliminated, and the overall welfare in the market would be maximized.\nI hope I have been able to clarify any questions or misconceptions you may have had\nregarding market failure.

      "essay": "March 26, 2024\nEconomics 101-200\n\nHi,\n\nI’m so sorry to hear about your family emergency. I can definitely explain market failure to you. \nFirstly, I want to discuss the idea of market failure itself. Essentially, market failure is when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome without any intervention, even in equilibrium. There are several different concepts that can play a role in market failure, but I think that it will be the easiest to consider market failure through the lens of Externalities. Externalities are a specific kind of market failure that can either be positive or negative depending on what effect they are having. This can be either an uncompensated cost imposed on others in the case of a negative externality or an unintended benefit received by unrelated individuals in the case of a positive externality.\nNext, I want to further clarify market failure for you by showing you an example of a negative externality market failure. This particular example comes from a recently published Washington Post article on how air pollution is preventing pollinators from accurately finding flowers. In the article, researchers describe how humans are having a significantly negative impact on animals who use scent in order to navigate their environment. In particular, the article focuses on an insect called a hawk moth, which can effectively sniff out wildflowers. However, the pollutant NO3, which is found in emissions from cars, coal plants, and other industrial sources, has been found to lessen scent chemicals that attract hawk moths. Thus, “wild moth visitation [has] dropped by about 70 percent” (Grandoni). This is a terrible consequence. \nHowever, I want to specify exactly how this article exemplifies an economic market failure through the role of the negative externality. The markets for items such as coal, cars, and other industrial items do not account for the uncompensated cost of the air pollution on the pollinators, who are not at all involved in the markets actually producing the pollution. Thus, the market is failing to function correctly and the efficient outcome is not being reached. The extent to which the pollution affects the third party–the pollinators–ensures that this is a clear example of a negative externality. This unjust allocation further exemplifies market failure through the future consequences of agricultural difficulties, a loss of fruit and vegetable production for human consumption, and “‘a huge change in the plant community’” (Grandoni) overall. \nI hope that this was helpful for you and that you can return to class soon. \n\nBest,\nYour Friend\nWord Count: 412\n \nWorks Cited\nGrandoni, Dino. “How air pollution prevents pollinators from finding their flowers.” The Washington Post, 8 February 2024, https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/08/air-pollution-pollinator-moths/. \n\n",

I’m emailing back with an example I found in a New York Times article that I think will help clarify the term “market failure” for you. It talks about the Texas wildfires that happened in February near Smokehouse Creek, which were started in Xcel Energy (the local electric utility company)’s electrical grids according to a state investigation. To give a very brief overview of how this fits as a market failure, it led to widespread power outages, property damage, and injury. The market failure in this article is Xcel’s lack of oversight and maintenance leading to negative externalities on community members not directly participating in the transaction. The type of market failure this is classified as is a negative externality, because Xcel’s failure to properly maintain its infrastructure resulted in harmful consequences to individuals beyond those directly involved in the energy utility market.\nTo elaborate on this further, let’s first clarify what a market failure is. Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services in a market where there is no government intervention is inefficient. Inefficiency can occur due to various reasons, such as externalities, public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods. This article features an externality. Externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service affects a third party, who is not directly involved in the market. If a benefit or cost in the market goes unaccounted for by the equilibrium quantities supplied and demanded, the total surplus isn't maximized, resulting in market failure. It's like a glitch in the system where the equilibrium quantities don't properly account for all the costs or benefits that impact third parties, resulting in less-than optimal results. An uncompensated cost is a negative externality, and an uncompensated benefit is a positive externality. \nThe NYT article I found features a negative externality. The Smokehouse Creek fires imposed costs on Xcel Energy to mitigate the fire’s impact on their power lines. The fires also brought additional costs to the broader community and the environment (the third parties in this case) such as widespread power outages, property damage, environmental damage, and injury. These negative externalities are not fully accounted for in the transactions in the energy utility market. When these external costs are not factored into the equilibrium quantities in the market the total surplus (or overall benefit to society) is not maximized. This imbalance between private marginal costs and social marginal costs is a classic example of market failure. \nI hope that this was helpful to your understanding of market failures.

      "essay": "Hey friend,\nSince you asked for help understanding market failure for our Econ101 class, I thought it\nmight be helpful to provide a specific example of market failure that clearly demonstrates what\nhappens when there are unaccounted effects from market activity that have subsequent impacts\non society. A market is said to fail when it does not reach its most efficient outcome while\noperating without government intervention. Producers and consumers engaging in a market\ngenerate an initial total surplus that is composed of producer surplus and consumer surplus. At\nthis level of activity, a certain equilibrium quantity and price are established. While producers\nand consumers engage in the market, their activity may result in consequences for an unrelated,\nthird party that are not initially considered in the given market. These consequences are\ndistinguished as externalities. Since the effects on such a third party are left unconsidered during\nthe allocation of goods and services within the market, consumers and producers operate at a\nlevel that is not socially optimal, or most efficient, for the entirety of society. Market efficiency is\nmeasured by the amount of total surplus generated by the market operating at a given level, or in\nother words, how much society as a whole is gaining and benefitting from the market. Despite\nnot being actively considered, both positive and negative external consequences have successive\nimpacts that influence society’s well-being. When society’s total surplus, or gain, fails to reach\nits maximum potential in neglect of its outcomes for all, the market is considered to be in a state\nof failure.\nConsider the case presented by Ewing’s article that discusses V olkswagen’s intention to\nincrease electric vehicle sales through the recreation of iconic V olkswagen car models with\nelectric capabilities (Ewing). V olkswagen customers, the consumer, and the V olkswagen\ncompany, the producer, buy and sell electric cars at a certain level in the market, establishing a\ncertain level of consumer and producer surplus at a market equilibrium quantity and price.\nHowever, the buying and selling of these electric vehicles result in lower carbon emissions and a\nreduction in pollution, positively impacting numerous individuals who do not directly engage in\nthe V olkswagen EV market. This extraneous benefit to a third party can be classified as a\npositive externality. When considering this externality in conjunction with the existing\nconsumer’s marginal benefit, the social marginal benefit, or the advantage gained by society as a\nwhole, is higher than that at equilibrium. As society’s total surplus including the affected third\nparty exceeds the market’s original total surplus at equilibrium, the V olkswagen electric vehicle\nmarket is said to fail. This means that the market equilibrium quantity of buying and selling\nelectric V olkswagen cars is lower than the quantity of buying and selling electric V olkswagen\ncars that would maximize society’s total benefit. I hope this explanation betters your\nunderstanding of market failure!\nBest,\nY our friend\nAnnotated Bibliography\nEwing, Jack. “V olkswagen Leans on Electric V ehicles and Nostalgia to Grow in U.S.” The New\nYork Times, 20 Feb. 2024, p.

Market failure occurs when without intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome even in equilibrium. As you may already know, the efficient outcome is where total surplus is maximized. There are many market failures, but I will focus on negative externalities. \n\tAn externality occurs when the free market doesn’t recognize when there are costs or benefits to other people, specifically people who are not in the market. I will also call these people third parties occasionally. Specifically, a negative externality is where an individual or firm imposes an uncompensated external cost on others. External costs are costs that are created from market transactions. Thus, the costs are incurred by parties who aren’t directly involved in transactions. For instance, people who pay for gas are paying for the ability to drive their car, yet they’re also paying for the unforeseen cost in the increased air pollution that’ll harm others. As a result of these unexpected costs, the equilibrium quantity is greater than the socially optimal quantity meaning that we’re producing too much. \n\tAccording to the article “The New Space Race Is Causing New Pollution Problems” published by The New York Times, space exploration has a negative effect on people and our environment. In the space industry, many people in that area of work consider environmental protection as an afterthought because they’re interested in exploring space and making new discoveries. Tim Malcay, the chief strategy officer for ClearSpace said, “We see the prospect of development and we tend to race into it without a tremendous amount of forethought on the environmental consequences” (Hall). Additionally, the number of satellite and rocket launches has spiked in recent years and only plans to increase in the coming years. But experts don’t want to bring an end to the space economy, however, they’re nervous about the long-term consequences it will have. “Experts say they do not want to limit the booming space economy. But they fear that the steady march of science will move slower than the new space race — meaning we may understand the consequences of pollution from rockets and spacecraft only when it is too late” (Hall). In this case, the companies interested in exploring space are the polluters since they’re making their decisions solely based on gaining profit and inspecting space without considering the direct, harmful impact they’re having on third parties. \n\tNegative externalities are not good for others (i.e., pollution and second-hand smoking), but they are inevitable since they have been established into our daily lives through market transactions. In fact, these external costs lead to market inefficiencies like overproduction. Nevertheless, as a society, once we become more aware about the external costs that we’re imposing on others, then we can help mitigate them. \n\nWord Count: 465 words\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nHall, Shannon. “The New Space Race Is Causing New Pollution Problems.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Jan. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/science/rocket-pollution-spacex-satellites.html?smid=url-share. \n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI heard you are interested in learning more about the concept of market failure that you missed\nfrom class. It is important to know that market failure occurs when the market fails to either\nreach the efficient outcome, or maximize total surplus, even when in equilibrium (without any\ngovernment intervention). There are a few important terms in this definition that are important to\nknow. An “efficient” outcome occurs when the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost.\nThe total surplus that was mentioned above is equivalent to the net gain of society. Society in\nthis case is both the producers and consumers, as well as any 3rd parties who are outside of the\nmarket yet affected by any externalities. Externalities are either a cost or benefit that is caused by\none party that is in turn received by an unrelated party. Externalities are one of many different\ntypes of market failures. Other examples of types of market failures include Public Goods,\nPrivate Goods, Artificially Scarce Goods, and Common Resources, which I will give further\ndetail to in a later example. These four examples all depend on whether or not they are\nexcludable or nonexcludable or are a rival or non-rival in consumption.\nA recent example of market failure occurred in the waters of Louisiana, where a drought caused\nthe crawfish population to plummet, thus making it unprofitable for local fishermen to make a\nprofit in their trade. Market failure is exemplified in this example as in interviewee in the article\nclaims that “crawfishing feels like more of a hobby than a business as costs exceed the catch”,\nwhich shows how the business would no longer be financially sustainable. This reflects market\nfailure definition I described before because it has become an inefficient business, as the\nmarginal costs of fishing now outweigh the marginal benefits. There is also a visible externality\nin this article, as risingg levels of pollution are likely causing environmental damage such as the\ndrought found in the area. This would be considered a negative externality because this pollution\nis creating additional cost to the fisherman due to the lowered crawfish population. Due to the\ncrawfishing industry not accounting for the additional marginal cost caused by said negative\nexternality, they are experiencing market failure.\nAnother type of market failure in the crawfishing example is common resource market\nfailure. Since it is difficult to limit only paying customers to eating crawfish, it is considered a\nnonexcludable good. As shown by the article, one person consuming crawfish lowers the supply\nin the market, thus making it harder for others to obtain it. This makes crawfish a rival in\nconsumption. Due to the drought, the supply of crawfish has greatly diminished while the\ndemand has stayed the same. This overconsumption of the finite number of crawfish has led to a\ncommon resource type of market failure.\nI hope this email has helped your understanding of market failure.\nFrom,\nYour Friend\nWords: 476\nWorks Cited\nCBS Interactive.

      "essay": "A market failure is an inefficient allocation of goods and services within an economic\nmarket, leading to an undesirable outcome for society. There are many reasons market failure\noccurs, including positive and negative externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods. Relating to types of goods, a good can be excludable or non-excludable.\nAn excludable good or service is one where the supplier can prevent consumers from using it\nbased on if they have paid. For example, a music album is an excludable good because you have\nto pay in order to listen; on the other hand, fish are considered non-excludable because everyone\nin society can have access to bodies of water and the fish within them. Additionally, a good can\nbe non-rival in consumption and consumed by more than one person at a time (for example,\nNetflix) or rival in consumption and limited to one person (a house). Now that you know these\ndefinitions, there are different categories of goods based on their rivalness and excludability. A\npublic good is non-rival and non-excludable, whereas an artificially scarce good is non-rival and\nexcludable, and a common resource is non-excludable yet rival. If a good is non-excludable or\nnon-rival (so any of these three types), it will cause the market to fail. This is because\nnon-excludable goods automatically lead to free riders, which are consumers utilizing a good\nwithout paying, causing inefficiency and market failure. Non-rival means that once the good is\nproduced, for each additional consumer there should be no marginal cost because there is no\nmarginal production cost (for example, it does not cause producers more for an additional\nconsumer to watch Netflix); however, this is not sustainable for the producer and therefore why\nmarket failure occurs.\nBeyond types of goods causing market failure, there is also the issue of positive and\nnegative externalities. Both involve a seemingly unrelated third party that is affected by the\nmarket of a good or service. For positive externalities, the third party benefits without the\nproducer receiving consumption; for negative externalities, the third party has an external cost\nimposed on them. The article I linked includes an example of a positive externality: it describes\nhow the increase in sales of electric cars affects the automobile labor market in Michigan. The\nincrease will decrease the labor demand market in Michigan because electric cars require much\nless physical labor, which is what the article focuses on. However, the increase in electric cars\nwill also subsequently decrease emissions and pollution because they don’t require gas or release\nfossil fuels when driving. This is a positive externality that is benefiting the market of\nsustainability. Y ou would not typically associate sustainability with the automobile industry in\nMichigan (unrelated third party) but it is actually greatly affected by the amount of pollution\nproduced. While this is a positive change, it still causes the market to fail because the producers\nof electric cars are not receiving any consumption for the benefits they are providing to the\nenvironment and society.\nWord Count: 500\nGoodman, Peter S. “For Michigan’s Economy, Electric V ehicles Are Promising and Scary.” The\nNew York Times, The New Y ork Times, 19 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/business/economy/michigan-economy-2024-election.html.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope all is okay at home. I understand that you missed our recent discussions of market failures\nand the many ways in which they manifest themselves in the economy. With that, I wanted to\nreach out to share this article I recently read in order to help you understand and visualize not\nonly what these market failures are but also how the government can approach correcting such a\nfailure.\nWithin any market system, there are situations in which the market fails to allocate resources\nefficiently – meaning that supply and demand are not at an equilibrium where the marginal\nbenefits equal the marginal costs. These failures can be categorized into externalities, public\ngoods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods. New laws, tariffs or taxes, subsidies, and\ntrade quotas can all serve as a means to redirect resources in a way that corrects such failures.\nNegative externalities, which is what we will focus on today, occur when the cost of a product\ndoes not reflect its full cost to society. This mispricing leads to overconsumption and deadweight\nloss as these external costs are not included in the original price.\nRecently, the Biden administration has been cracking down on the externalities surrounding the\nuse of private jets in the US. Y ou see, the use of private jets creates a negative externality, as\ntheir emissions contribute to environmental harm. Typically such externalities are handled\nthrough taxation, which aim to shift the supply curve upwards by adding the external cost to the\nprivate cost. Thus, President Biden has proposed, as quoted from the White House, to “increase\nthe fuel tax on corporate and private jet travel, so that corporate executives and other wealthy\nAmericans pay their fair share for the use of airspace and other public services.” (Forbes, 2024)\nBiden’s move will target the environmental impact of private jet use, a burden not proportionally\ncaptured by their cost of operations. This misalignment is what caused the market to overvalue\nprivate jet travel because it is cheaper for consumers than it should be when considering its full\nenvironmental impact. Moreover, the average citizen, who does not use these jets, faces the full\nenvironmental and social costs of climate change without actually contributing as significantly to\nthe problem.\nThe Biden administration is aiming to internalize this externality – effectively making private jet\ntravel more expensive. This adjustment will ensure that those who benefit from the use of these\njets also bear the external costs of the environmental and social impacts they create. Interestingly\nthough, the government has the option of what to tax. In this case, they can either tax the\npollution or they can tax the use of private jets directly. Biden plans to tax the use of private jets,\nthis could be because quantifying the amount of emissions and contributions to climate change\ncan be difficult.\nI hope this email helps you understand what a market failure can look like and how the\ngovernment can intervene in order to correct it.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3\n\nHi Friend,\nIn short, market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services at market equilibrium is inefficient. This means that when a certain market is at equilibrium, either too many or too few products are produced, leading to deadweight loss. There are many possible factors that create these inefficiencies. Some examples include externalities, common resources, public goods, artificially scarce goods, monopolies, and oligopolies. However, we haven’t been exposed to monopolies and oligopolies yet, so you should focus on understanding what the other sources of market failure are.\nThe market failure I will focus on in this email is externalities, or when a good or service has an uncompensated, indirect cost or benefit on an uninvolved third party. Thus, externalities have two classifications: negative externalities and positive externalities. A negative externality is when the externality creates a cost, and a positive externality refers to the creation of a benefit for the third party. Negative externalities cause deadweight loss, in which, at market equilibrium, the market produces too many of the goods. The opposite is true for positive externalities. In order to find the efficient quantity in markets with externalities, we need to find where the social marginal cost and social marginal benefit intersect, with the term social, meaning our society's marginal cost and benefit.\nI’ve found a recent article that addresses a real-world negative externality. The article refers to the large amounts of plastic pollution created by the healthcare industry, and more specifically, inhalers and epipens. The external cost created by this industry is pollution, as “the health care industry used more than 24 billion pounds of plastic in 2023 and is forecast to generate 38 billion pounds annually by 2028” (Alcorn) worldwide. This pollution is a negative externality because plastic pollution has many unaddressed social costs, such as environmental degradation. In this situation, multiple countries' governments have been trying to address the externality by “drafting a treaty proposal that might ban select single-use products and set goals for reducing plastics production worldwide” (Alcorn). There are a few ways in which governments can address negative externalities, such as pollution. These include environmental standards, emission taxes, and tradable emission permits. The treaty proposals in this real-life situation are an example of the government utilizing environmental standards in order to lower the external costs created by pollution. Emission taxes work by pushing the marginal cost to be equal to the social marginal cost, leading to the efficient outcome. The same is true for tradable emission permits, where the quantity of goods produced is limited to the efficient value.\nIn short, market failure is simply when the market equilibrium fails to reach the most efficient outcome possible without interference from the government. This is shown by the medical industry, since without the government stepping in with treaties, the market creates the negative externality of pollution.\nHere is the link to the article for reference: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/health/insulin-pens-inhalers-plastics-recycling.html?searchResultPosition=15\n\nGood Luck, Name\n\n",

      "essay": "As you most likely know, we have started to learn about market failures in class. I hope this\nemail assists you greatly in understanding these new and sometimes difficult topics for students.\nI have gathered an article that discusses the impact that climate change has had on rising\ninsurance premiums for home insurance, and now moving into health insurance (Khan). This\ngives an example of a market failure due to an externality, specifically a negative externality.\nGenerally speaking, a market failure occurs when the market fails to reach efficiency, i.e. not\nmaximizing the total surplus available. This can come in the form of common resources, public\ngoods, artificially scarce goods, and, of course, externalities. When we originally defined\nefficiency in class, it was stated as the point where cost and benefit intersected, and without any\noutside effect, or interference, this definition would hold temporarily. But in real life, some\nactions that are taken can also alter other unrelated markets. This is the basis for an externality,\nwith each action influencing a different market, and in the case of the article I chose, this\nrelationship of cause and effect is drawn between climate change and rising insurance premiums.\nBy allowing climate change to be the externality, one can see how it acts negatively in the eyes\nof the consumer.\nIn this case, specifically, we observe the market for burning fossil fuels. Where the quantity and\nprice are defined by the amount and price of fossil fuels burned. We know that each unit of fossil\nfuels burned contributes to the climate change that is causing insurance companies to raise their\nrates (Khan)(Dudley, 4). So, this creates a uniform sum of marginal cost, which is directly\ncorrelated with the amount of burning. Total surplus is still calculated by adding together all\nforms of surplus, but additionally, this total external cost as well. Numerically, this external cost\nis a negative total surplus and therefore subtracts from the original total surplus. To achieve\nefficiency, the market needs to operate at the price that allows the social marginal benefit, supply\nplus the external cost, to intersect the original demand line. Graphically, this is achieved through\ndrawing the SMB line a fixed amount above the supply curve, the distance is determined by the\nmarginal cost (Dudley, 7). With an upward shift in supply and no change in demand, every time\nthere is a negative externality, the quantity of efficiency will decrease. This means that negative\nexternalities lead to overproduction at market equilibrium compared to the efficient outcome\n(Dudley, 15). This decrease in quantity is necessary due to the external cost, which exceeds the\nefficient outcome, and consequently creating deadweight loss. Minimizing deadweight loss is\nmaximizing total surplus, and this is achievable through taxes and quotas which can limit the\nexchange of goods allowing for the quantity to recede to efficiency (Dudley, 17).\nWord Count: 467\nWorks Cited\nKhan, Y usuf. “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance.

      "essay": "Hey man,\nI’d love to help you understand what market failure is! Market failure is when the free market\nhasn’t reached true efficiency. Looking at a supply and demand graph, you might have thought\nthat efficiency was always where equilibrium was reached. That’s not true though! One type of\nmarket failure is externalities! There are two types of externalities. Negative externalities are\nuncompensated costs that an individual or firm imposes on others, such as air pollution as\ncompanies can pollute the air and hurt people who live nearby uncompensated. The supply and\ndemand graph shows negative externalities by adding the total external cost to the producer’s\nmarginal cost, the supply line. Added up, this new line is called the social marginal cost line. The\narea bounded by the demand line, the social marginal cost line, the supply line, and the quantity\nsupply at equilibrium is the deadweight loss due to the externality. Coase's theorem addresses\nthis deadweight loss though, saying that an economy can still be efficient as long as the\ntransaction cost of a deal is low enough! Goods/services that have negative externalities produce\ntoo many units to be efficient and are efficient at where the social marginal cost line and the\ndemand line intercept.\nThe other type of externality is positive externalities, which are benefits that an individual or\nfirm gives to others without receiving compensation such as vaccines! V accines can reduce the\nwidespread of viruses if enough people take the vaccines. On the supply and demand graph,\npositive externalities can be seen by adding the total external benefit to the consumer’s marginal\nbenefit, the demand, this line is called the social marginal benefit line. The area bounded by the\ndemand line, the social marginal benefit line, the supply line, and the quantity supply at\nequilibrium is the deadweight loss due to the externality. Through Coase’s theorem, goods and\nservices that have positive externalities produce too few units to be efficient and are efficient at\nwhere the social marginal benefit line and the supply line intercept.\nExternalities happen because the market doesn't internalize the detriments/benefits of the\nproduction of the good/service. Consumers, individually, can take into account the\npositive/negative externalities of the good/service. This is called internalized externalities.\nThese principles can be seen in the article I shared with you above! The article talks about how\nthe SEC, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has placed a law on companies to\ndisclose their greenhouse gas emissions, from direct emissions to energy purchases. However,\nthe SEC fails to require companies to disclose their indirect emissions.

      "essay": "Market Failure – First Draft\nDear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you before I do.\nMarket failure occurs when a market does not reach the most efficient outcome at equilibrium, leading to a misallocation of resources leaving certain parties worse off. A way to measure the efficiency of a market is to calculate the total surplus through supply and demand analysis. If we notice that the total surplus at equilibrium is less than at the most efficient outcome, we know the market has failed. As you should recall from the unit on marginal analysis, we know that the most efficient outcome occurs where social marginal cost intersects social marginal benefit, and there are many possible reasons that social marginal cost and social marginal benefit may differ from the supply and demand curves. One of these reasons is negative and positive externalities. \nAn externality is a side effect caused by the actions of one that are incurred on another third party without compensation. A negative externality would be an external cost one imposes on another, and a positive externality would be a benefit one incurs from another. I recently read an article from NYT linked below discussing pollution, a common type of negative externality. The article discusses how the E.P.A. recently passed a rule lowering the amount of fine particulate emission by industries. The E.P.A. administrator said this rule would prevent around 4,500 deaths and 290,000 lost workdays because of illness. The negative externality in this article is pollution since society is incurring a cost from the pollution generated by certain industries. The pollution harms workers and thus creates an external marginal cost based on how much these industries produce. If we created a graph with supply and demand, we would see the social marginal benefit curve is identical to the demand curve since there isn’t any external benefit. However, the social marginal cost curve would be greater than the supply curve since we are adding the constant external marginal cost caused by pollution. If we calculate the area between the social marginal benefit and social marginal cost curves at equilibrium, we see that we have both positive and negative total surplus. However, if we calculate the area at efficiency where social marginal cost intersects social marginal benefit, we have only positive total surplus. Thus, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently at market equilibrium, leading to an overproduction of the goods causing pollution.\nThe article also demonstrates one of the common ways the government can intervene and fix market failure – environmental standards. In the article, the E.P.A. regulates emissions by industries to limit the amount of pollution created. This ultimately will reduce the external cost and bring the market closer to efficiency. Another way to mitigate negative externalities not discussed in the article is to impose a tax on the market, such as one based off the amount of emissions from the producers, raising the producer marginal cost to be closer to the social marginal cost. This is often much cheaper but fails to directly address the negative externality.\nI hope this helps clear things up!\nAnother day another slay,\nYour friend\n\nArticle: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html\n(494 words)\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well! I know the term “market failure” has been confusing for\nyou, so I found an example of climate change as a negative externality in the market of insurance\nto help explain the concept of market failure to you. Market failure occurs when, absent of any\nintervention, the market is unable to reach its efficient outcome, even in equilibrium. This means\nthat the market is not maximizing total surplus and therefore has deadweight loss.\nThe article “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance. Is Health Insurance Next?” from\nthe Wall Street Journal I found talks about how climate change has increased home insurance,\nand will soon do the same to health insurance (Khan). This is due to climate change’s negative\neffects, specifically temperature rise and wildfires, on the environment and therefore living\nconditions. In addition, it talks about how not all people are affected by climate change equally,\nand the people who are most at risk for the negative effects are usually lower income and\nhistorically marginalized groups. This is an example of climate change acting as a negative\nexternality in the market of insurance. It is a negative externality because climate change is a\nresult of humans acting on the environment through everyday actions that are resulting in\ntemperature rise and wildfires. These results not only have a negative effect on insurance,\ncausing a rise in prices, but they also have a negative, and unequal, effect on people in their\nliving conditions.\nNegative externalities cause a market failure because the market's equilibrium price no\nlonger represents the true cost of the good. For the example described in the article, The market\nof insurance equilibrium price does not take into account climate change, therefore when faced\nwith this issue insurance prices are forced to rise, and therefore stray from equilibrium creating a\ndeadweight loss. Climate change is also coming from all humans who do not all have to pay the\nextra cost. For example, wildfire dangers cause home insurance costs to rise in certain areas like\nCalifornia, but California residents are not the only people causing the temperature rise that\nmakes wildfires happen. In addition, most people who are at the highest risk to the negative\neffects of climate change are usually lower income and historically marginalized groups,\nmeaning polluters all over the world are causing these groups to pay a higher cost of insurance.\nI hope this article, “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIt is good to hear that you are keeping up with the coursework while you are away, the concept of\nmarket failure can definitely be a tricky one. The short of it is that market failure is when a\nmarket fails to reach its efficient outcome when there is no outside intervention. That is to say\nthat, for one reason or another, the market does not maximize total surplus when left on its own.\nA particular example of market failure discussed in class were externalities. An externality is\nwhen a third party (one outside of the market) is affected by the business done within the market.\nExternalities can be positive, when the third party benefits from the market, or they can be\nnegative, when a third party suffers in some way due to the market. Both are considered a market\nfailure. When an externality is negative the efficient quantity of goods is less than the market\nquantity. This is because there is a “total external cost” that must be considered. This external\ncost contributes to the “social marginal cost,” which is seen as the new supply curve when\nconsidering the externality. This curve intersects the demand curve at a quantity lower than the\nsupply curve, creating the efficient quantity. Since the market is not operating at this efficient\nquantity total surplus is not maximized and the market is considered to be a failure.\nFor more context, a specific example of a negative externality can be seen in a New Y ork Times\narticle written by Ted Alcorn titled Your Inhalers and EpiPens Aren’ t V ery Healthy for the\nEnvironment. Alcorn describes his history with Type 1 diabetes, and how as a kid he had to carry\n“glass syringes and vials of insulin,” (Alcorn, 2024). Alcorn was understandably ecstatic when,\nin 1985, a disposable alternative debuted. Like many others who suffer from severe allergies,\nasthma, or other ailments, the plastic solutions to these problems were a godsend. Alcron then\ngoes on to discuss, however, the negative impacts of using these disposable, life saving, tools.\nThe abundance of plastic used to create these single use items contributes to the pollution\nproblem currently facing the world. In economic terms, the market of disposable medical\nequipment is failing because it exacts an external cost on society, thus decreasing total surplus. A\nthird party (the world) suffers from the use of disposable medical equipment. The impact of these\nplastic products generates a monetary cost for people affected by the pollution, this is what is\nreferred to as the total external cost. The existence of the external cost means that the market is\nnot operating at an efficient quantity. The efficient quantity of disposable medical items is less\nthan the current amount being sold currently because a lower quantity of goods would decrease\nthe external cost on society and total surplus would be maximized.\nI hope this email finds you well and I hope you found it helpful.\nBest,\nFriend\nWord Count: 490\nWorks Cited\nAlcorn, T.

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI heard you missed out on the lecture about market failure. Market failure is when the market\nfails to reach the eﬃcient outcome which is when total surplus is not maximized. It is important\nto stress that this occurs when there is no intervention from an outside party like the government.\nEﬃciency is when the overall net gain (total surplus) is where the marginal benefit curve\n(demand curve) intersects the marginal cost curve (supply curve).\nMarket failure occurs when externalities disrupt market equilibrium.\nExternalities are the consequences due to the actions of the parties within the market that aﬀect\nunrelated groups. There are positive and negative externalities. A positive externality is a benefit\ngiven to others that are removed from the market. The social marginal benefit is the total benefit\nto society of the production of an additional unit of a good/service which is made up of the\nbenefit of the consumers and the positive externality. A negative externality is an uncompensated\ncost on those not involved in the market.\nThe social marginal cost is the total cost to society of the production of an additional unity of a\ngood/service which is made of the marginal cost to produce the good/service plus the negative\nexternality. When there is only a negative externality, the demand curve is the SMB or when\nthere is only a positive externality then the supply curve is the SMC. Where the social marginal\nbenefit curve intersects the supply (SMC) and the social marginal cost curve intersects the\ndemand (SMB) is where market eﬃciency is. Market failure is measured from the diﬀerence in\ntotal surplus from equilibrium to eﬃciency, the loss of total surplus of the market failing to be\neﬃcient is known as a negative total surplus aka the deadweight loss.\nThe article called “Global Carbon Emissions Hit Another Record High in 2023 despite Strong\nRenewables Growth” exemplifies a negative externality. The article is about the record high of\nglobal CO2 emissions in 2023. It is about the reliance of some countries on CO2 that has led to\nan increase in emissions. The market failure is the CO2 emissions due to the production of a\ngood. The emissions do not only negatively impact the companies that caused the emissions, but\nare also imposed on outside parties which are the environment/society as the emissions can lead\nto health problems and environmental issues. The market fails to accommodate for this negative\nexternality. The companies produce goods and services to maximize profits rather than taking\ninto account the consequences of their production which includes the negative externality of\npollution. In order for the market to be eﬃcient, there should be a decrease in production to oﬀset\nthe negative externality so essentially the supply curve will be where the social marginal cost\ncurve is located. This decrease in production ensures that there is no deadweight loss since the\nsupply curve moves in place of the SMC.\nWord Count: 490",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\tI am sorry about your family emergency. I am happy to help you stay up to date with course content. In class, we recently learned about market failure. Market failure is any time when the market can not reach an efficient outcome. In other words, the market is unable to maximize its total surplus. \n\tWe measure market failure by identifying the total surplus at market equilibrium and measuring the maximum total surplus at the efficient outcome. The difference between society's net gain and total surplus at market equilibrium is market failure, or, in other words, the deadweight loss. \n\tMarket failures can occur through negative externalities, positive externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. Negative externalities are when a third party experiences a cost due to a specific industry. Likewise, positive externalities benefit a third party that is not part of the market. Common resources are over-consumed because there is no price on the good, but as more people enjoy the good, fewer people are able to use it. For common resources the social marginal cost exceeds the private marginal cost, so the efficient supply for a good is not met in society. Public goods are non-rival in consumption and non-excludable, meaning there is no price on the good, and one more person's use of the good does not affect the ability for others to use it. Public goods do not meet efficiency when left to the private market to supply. Finally, artificially scarce goods are an example of market failure because producers set a price on these goods even though the marginal cost of allowing one more person access to the good is zero. Producers setting a price on the good creates deadweight loss. \n\tTo help you understand these concepts, it may be helpful to provide a real-life example of market failure. I recently read a New York Times article by Andrew Jacobs called \"Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.\" In Jacobs' article, he explains how scientists have discovered microplastics in sea animals and, more recently, the human body. The market failure in Jacob's article is the negative externality of microplastics in the human body due to trash from the plastic production market. As a reminder, a negative externality is a market failure that is caused by an industry creating an external cost on a third party. Plastic-producing companies create various plastic products to sell to consumers, but these companies have no intention of creating microplastics that affect the environment. In other words, the appearance of microplastics in humans and animals is an external cost caused by firms producing plastic products. Producers' external cost of microplastics in the human body is a significant negative externality. \n\tI hope I helped you understand market failure.

This difference is the difference between the efficient market price, which is where society maximizes surplus and the equilibrium price, which is where society currently produces the good. This deviation often causes Dead Weight Loss in society because resources are not optimally allocated. This deviation usually arises due to various factors, one of which is externalities. Externalities occur when the actions of producers or consumers impose costs or benefits on others who are not directly involved in the transaction. There are two main types of externalities: positive and negative. Positive externalities generate additional benefits for society beyond the equilibrium quantity. In contrast, negative externalities result in costs that are not accounted for in the market, leading to overproduction or overconsumption of certain goods. This can be in various factors; for example, vaccines are a positive externality because others benefit from the consumption of a good, and pollution is a negative externality where others incur the cost of producing a good. \nAn illustrative example of a negative externality in today's world can be found in a recent article from CBS News discussing the devastating toll that drought conditions have taken on the Louisiana crawfish industry. The article highlights how the dwindling water levels in the Mississippi River, caused by drought, have severely impacted the crawfish habitat, consequently affecting the industry's production output. While the direct cause of the water shortage may not be linked to the crawfish industry itself, other sectors, such as agriculture which relies heavily on water resources of the Mississippi, or the oil industry through climate change, cause the drought and contribute to the problem indirectly. By consuming or otherwise impacting water levels, these industries impose costs on the crawfish industry, disrupting its operations and leading to significant economic losses.\nThis situation exemplifies a negative externality, where the costs incurred by the crawfish industry are not reflected in the equilibrium quantity of water consumption. As a result, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, leading to a suboptimal outcome for society as total surplus is not maximized. This decrease in total surplus, as mentioned in the article, signifies a loss of economic welfare due to the negative impact of unrelated industries on the crawfish industry, impacting a “300 million dollar industry” reducing its productiveness “less than 10%” of a normal year (Shamlain). This inefficiency in resource allocation represents a market failure, highlighting the importance of addressing externalities and implementing corrective measures to ensure the efficient functioning of markets and the maximization of societal welfare. Through understanding examples like this, we can grasp the significance of market failure and the need for policy interventions to mitigate its effects and promote economic efficiency.\nSincerely,\nYour Friend\n\nWord Count: 487\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCBS News. “Drought takes devastating toll on Louisiana crawfish industry.” CBS News, CBS Interactive Inc., 23 Jan. 2024, www.cbsnews.com/news/drought-devastating-toll-louisiana-crawfish-industry/.\n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nMarket failure is when, without any intervention, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even in equilibrium. In the article, the idea that pollution and climate change is discussed as causing market failures, in the form of negative and externalities. \nNegative externalities pose an issue or a cost to an unrelated third party. For example, in the article, natural disasters are given a connection to mortgage risks. So, if an area is more likely to have a hurricane, the mortgage risk is high. This would be an example of a negative externality. Here, the pollution being produced by manufacturers is affecting homeowners and banks’ mortgage risk. Because the cost and benefit is not presented directly in the prices of the manufactured goods, that cost must be apparent somewhere else. Positive externalities on the other hand produce a benefit for an unrelated third party. This would be exemplified best if thought about in terms of vaccinations and mass immunity. If 90% of the population is vaccinated, the other unvaccinated 10% benefits from the idea of herd immunity. \nMarket failure is measured in 3 steps. Step one, identify the total surplus at equilibrium. This would be the total of consumer and producer surplus, or society’s net gain from the market. In our example of pollution and climate change caused by manufacturing, the producer surplus would be the profit they are making off the good that causes pollution when manufacturing. The consumer surplus would be the benefits that consumers are gaining from having that manufactured product. \nStep two, identify the efficient outcome. Efficiency is the maximum total surplus of the market, or where society’s total net gain is maximized. This is where social marginal benefit and social marginal cost intersect. When there is a negative externality as we are discussing, the social marginal cost is higher than the supply, as it is the producer's marginal cost plus the negative externality.\nThree, measure the difference between steps one and two. Here, we would subtract the total external cost from the total surplus, leaving us with a total surplus that does not maximize, and therefore is inefficient. \nIf we assign values to this example it may be easier to understand. Let’s say our consumer surplus is $600, and our producer surplus is $800. Our total surplus would then be $1400. This becomes our efficient value. Our externality is now imposed, and it is $300. We would then subtract $300 from our $1400, leaving us with $1100. We can see that $1100 is not our efficient value of $1400 and therefore, makes the market inefficient and causes failure.\nHope this explanation helped,\n\tYour Friend\n\nWord count: 433\n",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nSome examples of market failures include externalities and non-private goods such as public, artificially scarce, and common goods. In this letter, I will focus solely on externalities, more specifically a negative externality caused by electric cars, but first some prerequisite information.\n\tAn externality is an unaccounted-for cost or benefit received by a third party that is not directly involved in the market that caused the externality. As you may recall from earlier lectures, we know that equilibrium price and quantity are located at the intersection of supply (marginal cost) and demand (marginal benefit). In the case of an externality, the equilibrium in a given market is inefficient. The inefficiency is present because there is a marginal social cost or marginal social benefit that isn’t taken into account. Once it is accounted for the social cost or benefit will be greater than the private cost or benefit. The point where marginal social cost and marginal social benefit intersect will be the efficient point when an externality is present.\n\tThere are many real-life examples of externalities, many of which can be found in daily publications. Recently The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that particulate pollution is far more prominent in the case of electric vehicles which have heavier frames due to the weight of batteries (“Electric Cars Emit More Particulate Pollution”). This particulate matter is a perfect example of a negative externality.\n\tAt market equilibrium, the sellers and buyers of electric vehicles reach an agreement on a price that is representative of the intersection of the marginal cost of the supplier and the marginal benefit of the consumers. This price however does not represent the efficient outcome because of the negative externality it produces. The particulate matter produced by the vehicles has a negative impact on the general population in the form of health defects. In theory, a price, quota, or legislation can be placed on the detriment caused by this pollution that would compensate for the health issues and reduce the quantity supplied to an efficient level… Yes, there is a socially optimal level of pollution.\n\tSome potential ways this could be done is by calculating the monetary cost of these health implications and taxing drivers based on the number of miles they travel or taxing electric car companies on the weight of their car. Consumers may not like being tracked so it would make more sense in this scenario to tax based on weight, which would also encourage innovation by electric car companies. There are also tradable emission permits that specify the number of tires that can be produced, permits are then given to production companies and are typically traded to the most efficient producers. This results in an efficient level of production by the most efficient producers. In some scenarios, the government may even implement guidelines that all tire production companies must follow such as reducing the rate of tire wear by a given amount within a certain time frame.\n\nBest,\nYour Friend.\n\n\nWord Count: 493\n\n\n\nCitations\nBuschbatcher, M.

      "essay": "Hello dear friend,\nI hope this email reaches you well. I wanted to follow up our conversation last week and\nexplain what a market failure is to you and give you a pretty recent example about how market\nfailures come to exist. First off, to explain what a market failure is; a market failure is when the\nmarket is producing goods and services at a suboptimal efficiency. This is often caused by one or\na plethora of factors, including but not limited to: externalities, common resources, public goods,\nand artificially scarce goods, which leads to resources not being efficiently allocated in the\nmarket. If the good is not a private good, or it produces externalities by affecting non-involved\nparties either positively or negatively, it will lead into a decrease in market efficiency which ends\nup causing a market failure. Government involvement is a common market failure, since\nresources aren’t being properly allocated to ensure market efficiency. Another common example\nof a market failure is when externalities like pollution rise up. Pollution is a negative externality,\nmeaning that it will negatively affect those not involved in the transaction. Such a recent\nexample is the Stanley Tumbler craze.\nAs you probably already know, the Stanley Tumbler is a reusable container meant to hold\ndrinks and keep them warm or cold for extended periods of time. The whole issue here is that,\ndue to recent advertising campaigns by the company and a social media craze over limited\nedition cups, the demand for these cups has skyrocketed, which has caused multiple issues\nregarding the purpose and the usage of the cups. The Stanley cups are meant to be a reusable\ncup, so the possession of multiple stanley cups results in the rest of the cups not having much of\na use, severely diminishing the marginal benefit after the first cup. Now, the production of\nstainless steel (the material the tumblers are made of) is very energy intensive and very polluting\nto the environment, the very thing it is trying to work against. This (as explained above) can\ncause a very negative impact on those who have little to no interaction with the transaction. So in\nreality, the current allocative efficiency is lower than the current market equilibrium, hence the\ninefficiency.\nI hope this email clears things up from before, let me know if you have any more\nquestions.\nWarm regards,\nSource:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/climate/stanley-mug-sustainability.html?searchRes\nultPosition=18\nWord count: 409",

      "essay": "Hey friend!\nMarket failure is when the free market fails to allocate resources efficiently, leading to\nmisallocating resources. In other words, this creates a situation where there is either too much or\ntoo little of a good or service being produced or consumed. This inefficiency can occur due to\nmany distinct factors, such as externalities and public goods. Externalities lead to market failures\nbecause they involve uncompensated costs or benefits incurred on an unrelated group. To clarify,\nfor negative externalities, a group has to suffer losses from decisions they did not make, meaning\nthere is an excess of a good compared to the efficient level. For positive externalities, there are\nbenefits a group gains from not doing anything, meaning that there is a shortage of these units\nbeing made compared to the efficient level. Public goods can be examples of market failures\nbecause they are non-excludable and non-rival in consumption, leading to the free-rider problem.\nBecause individuals aren’t obligated to pay for these goods, they are undervalued and\nunderprovided by the market. It’s important to note that market failures can be fixed through\ngovernment intervention, such as taxes, subsidies, regulation, or property rights.\nI recently read an article about a $100 million donation to a college. While this donation\nwas intended to improve the accessibility to education through scholarships and the colleges’\neducational infrastructure, it presents an inherent market failure. This is an example of a positive\nexternality because the donation to the college positively benefits the direct recipients (students\nand the institution) but also has positive spill-over effects on society by contributing to the\neducation and empowerment of individuals, potentially encouraging social and economic\ndevelopment. In marginalized communities, there tends to be an underinvestment in educational\nresources, leading to disparities in access to quality education, perpetuating a cycle of\nsocioeconomic inequality in certain segments of the population.\nThis example can also tie into the concept of public goods. Some education can be\nconsidered a public good if it is free and can be accessed by many people at once, However, the\nfree market may underprovide education due to the presence of positive externalities, where the\nsocial benefits of education are not fully compensated for by the market. For this reason, there is\na market failure in how donations are often needed to mitigate disparities in access to education.\nSo in summary, the large donation to the college presents an example of a positive\nexternality because of how it directly benefits the students and institution, but also benefits\nsociety as the third party because a more educated population will foster social and economic\ndevelopment. In this way, the donation to college is an uncompensated benefit, and society is\nproviding too few of these kinds of educational donations.\nHope this helps,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 462\nWorks Cited\nSaul, Stephanie. “Spelman, a Historically Black Women’s College, Receives $100 Million Gift.”\nThe New York Times, The New Y ork Times, 18 Jan. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/01/18/us/spelman-donation-hbcu.html?smid=url-share.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failure is when the market is not functioning at an efficient level. It is, by\ndefinition, the “inefficient distribution of resources that occurs when the individuals in a\ngroup end up worse off than if they had not acted in rational self-interest”(Investopedia)\nOne thing that can cause market failure is externalities. Externalities are costs or\nbenefits an outside source receives without compensation. An example of an externality\ngiven in class is housing. If you are from a nice neighborhood and your neighbor has a\ntrashed house with an overgrown lawn, then your house's price is driven down. The\nneighbor has a negative impact on your home value, which is a negative externality. If\nthis did not change the price of your house, then that would be market failure due to\ninefficiency.\nThe article I sent, “Concrete Is One of the World’s Worst Pollutants. Making It\nGreen Is a Booming Business,” by the Wall Street Journal, gives an example of market\nfailure through a negative externality in the manufacturing industry of concrete. It\ndiscussed how concrete is one of the world's worst pollutants but is also an extremely\ncheap and reliable material worldwide for manufacturers. They say in the article that\n“Concrete accounts for more than 7% of global carbon emissions, according to some\nestimates.”(WSJ), however, the cost of this global impact through emissions is not\naccounted for or reflected in the price to manufacture or sell concrete. This is the market\nfailure shown by the article because the cost of concrete is so low, but the emissions\nare so high that the cost of pollution is not accounted for. This creates a price that the\nrest of society has to pay to try and equal out the cost of pollution caused by others. The\ninefficiency of the market is a perfect example of market failure by the producer and\nconsumer paying a low price, but the external cost is placed upon people outside of the\nproducer and consumer.\nIt also covers how companies are trying to come up with alternative eco-friendly\nconcrete, but it is too expensive to catch on with manufacturers. An example of this is a\nquote from a managing partner at a company trying to develop eco-friendly concrete,\n“Cement is sort of this wonder material,” he said. “It’s so cheap, it’s so valuable, it’s so\ngood for what we need that it’s really hard to think of ways around it.”(WSJ). He says\nthere's no way around using concrete but hopefully, there can be a way that cuts\nemissions because otherwise, there is nothing that will stop the global emissions. An\nexample of a solution would be a tax on either producer or consumer to pay for external\nmarginal costs.\nBest,\nStone Anderson\nConcrete Is One of the World’s Worst Pollutants.

      "essay": "To: My Friend\nSubject: Re: Market Failure Confusion\nHi Friend,\nThank you for reaching out. This is definitely a confusing topic but I am here to help. To start, let\nme give you an explanation of what market failure is. Market failure can be defined as when\ngoods and services are not distributed optimally by a free market. Market failure occurs when\nindividuals act in their own best interest, but a suboptimal outcome is reached. A suboptimal\noutcome occurs when an inefficient quantity is produced. Some examples of common market\nfailures include externalities, monopolies, and asymmetric information.\nA perfect example of a market failure that can help you better understand the concept stems from\nan article I read recently titled “How One Texas County Is Fighting 43,000 Monkeys” from the\nWall Street Journal. In this article, the author discusses how Charles River Laboratories has\npurchased 500 acres of land in rural Brazoria County, Texas to house tens of thousands of\nmonkeys for research purposes. Residents of Brazoria County are outraged by their new\nneighbors. Farmers and residents in the surrounding communities are concerned their property\nvalues will fall and the monkeys will spread disease.\nThis market failure is caused by a negative externality. A negative externality occurs when there\nis an external cost to people not involved in the market transaction. In this case, land was sold to\nCharles River Laboratories from the previous land owner. The residents of Brazoria County incur\nthe external cost of their land being devalued and the potential spread of disease due to the\npresence of the research primates. The residents were not a part of this transaction in the real\nestate market so the cost they incur is a negative externality. When negative externalities are\npresent there is too much of a good or service produced. In this specific case, since a negative\nexternality is produced due to the presence of the primates, too much land is allocated at too low\nof a price to the research laboratory. The marginal social cost curve is the supply curve plus the\nmarginal external cost. If we took into account the negative externality, the optimal quantity and\nprice would be found where the marginal social cost curve intersects the demand curve.\nI am so sorry to hear about your family emergency, but I hope my explanation of market failure\nand the example I provided helps you better understand this concept and stay up to date on the\ncourse material.

      "essay": "Dear friend, \nI’m responding to your previous email about your confusion surrounding market failure. Market failure is the idea that the economy isn’t operating at the most efficient level because it is failing to account for an outside influence. Take the article I attached as an example, it discusses the negative effects that global warming, which is caused by CO2 emissions, has had on the tradition of “summering” in Switzerland. This is where they bring sheeps, goats, and cows into the mountains to graze for the summer. However, due to drought and receding glacial levels, there is a scarcity of water for the animals which is negatively affecting the market for products they produce, such as Swiss cheeses (Porter). \nThis is an example of a negative externality, which is a type of market failure defined by an uncompensated cost that is imposed on another entity who was not involved in the creation of the “cost”. We know that global warming is caused by CO2 emissions in general, but to simplify let's say that all emissions were caused by cars. Using the example of Swiss summering, the uncompensated cost for the production of cars would be global warming and the negative effect that it has on the market for Swiss animal productions and the honored tradition of summering those animals in the Swiss Alps.\nThis negative effect isn't being accounted for when we calculate the market price and quantity of cars, leading to an inefficiency in the market for automobiles. What we need to do is add this negative externality to our supply curve (marginal cost) to create social marginal cost, or the total cost to society. This will end up looking similar to a supply shift to the left, pushing quantity down and price up. Thinking back to marginal analysis, the efficient quantity is where social marginal cost and social marginal benefit intersect. Because there is no social marginal benefit, we will use demand (marginal benefit) instead. After we account for the negative impact of emissions on the Swiss tradition of summering, the efficient quantity of cars should be lower than the market quantity in the automobile market.\nThe efficient price and quantity of cars is lower than the market quantity because now we are accounting for the negative effects of emissions on the Swiss summering of farm animals. In simple terms, car emissions are bad for society and the market for Swiss goods, so to get the best benefit to society, we should decrease the quantity of cars in the automobile market. \nI hope this clarifies the concept of market failure.

      "essay": "Hi! Hope everything is going well amidst everything going on. I know you needed some help on the concept of market failure from our Econ 101 class, so I'm reaching out with some information to help you better understand:\n\nMarket failure refers to a situation in which the allocations of goods and services by a free market are not efficient and therefore do not maximize total surplus. This inefficiency leads to a net of social welfare loss. There are two types of market failures we focused on in class: positive externalities and negative externalities. Negative externalities cause an external cost to the market, whereas a positive externality is an external benefit that is not taken into account by the two parties involved. \n\nTo further dive into this concept I have an article to show the example of a negative externality: This article is by Gabriel J.X Dance and is titled “Anxiety Mood Swings and Sleepless Nights: LIfe near a Bitcoin Mine: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html\n\nThis article delves into an example of a negative externality airing from Bitcoin mining facilities. As previously explained, negative externalities occur when two parties, consumers and producers, end up creating an uncompensated cost to an unaffiliated 3rd party. Consequently, the market equilibrium results in too many units of uncompensated goods compared to the efficient level. Dance discusses how the incessant noise from the Bitcoin mines disturbs residents, and the noise pollution leads to anxiety, mood swings, and sleep deprivation. The social costs (poor health and a reduced quality of life) are borne by the community while the miners absorb the profits without compensating those affected. Hence this scenario vividly demonstrates a market failure: although the mining is profitable to the miners, it imposes significant costs on the nearby population. \n\nThe free market, left on its own, isn't accounting for these unpriced consequences, leading to more mining activity than what would be socially optimum. Market failures like negative externalities need corrective measures, often by government interventions like taxes, regulations, or subsidies to better align private incentives with social well-being. \n\nThis article also lightly touches on two types of goods discussed in class; common resources and public Goods. As discussed in class, common resources are nonexcludable but rival in consumption. This means the goods can be accessed without paying a price, but it’s limited in consumption. Public goods are neither excludable nor rival to consumption, making them accessible to the public with no costs or restrictions. In this example, the environment--clean air--is a common resource prone to overuse when unregulated. This is because air becomes less clean once it has been breathed in by one consumer. \n\nI hope this helped you better understand the concept of market failure! \n\nWord count: 458\n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nMarket failure is when the market is not allocating its resources efficiently and meeting society’s needs. Examples of this failure are positive and negative externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.  I specifically want to focus on negative externalities in my explanation of market failures.\n\tAn externality is cost or benefit forced on an unrelated 3rd party due to the actions of an individual or firm. A positive externality is when this 3rd party benefits from the actions of the individual or firm, called external benefit. This happens when a resource is underproduced and the population would benefit from having more produced. A negative externality is when this 3rd party must pay for or is negatively affected by the actions of the individual or firm, called external cost. This happens when a resource is overproduced and the population would benefit from having less of said resource.\n\tOne example of negative externalities is pollution. As online shopping and fast shipping continue, more buildings called logistic hubs are being opened closer to residential areas to bring the fastest service to communities. These buildings are very large and constantly have trucks coming in and out of them. Local communities consider these logistics hubs to be visual pollution and the flow of vehicles to be noise pollution. In Deerfield, Illinois, the community members banded together to reject a developer’s plan to build a vast logistics hub where there had previously been a 101-acre campus (Grant 2). Community members believe the logistics hubs are ugly sites that hurt the aesthetic of their community. Additionally, all of the noise that they produce is hurting their ears and costing them the enjoyment of a quieter community. These specific members have nothing to do with the size of the building or sound of the trucks, yet it is costing them (Grant 4).\n\tIn Deerfield, the market is not allocating its resources efficiently because the cost to the community members outweighs the gain that they would get from having a nearby logistic center. If they were in dire need of materials produced by the center constantly, then it would make sense for them to put up with these costs because they are benefiting more so, but that is not the case.\nIf there were to be a logistics hub built, the way to get to market efficiency is by lessening the costs on the citizens. Examples would be to alleviate some of the noise pollution by switching to quieter electric vehicles or building the hubs partially underground to reduce as much visual pollution. \nSo, to recap, market failure is inefficient resource allocation. The negative externality of pollution is the overproduction of resources that create a cost for an unrelated 3rd party. In Deerfield Illinois, the market was failing because visual and noise pollution of logistic hubs was costing the citizens more than it was benefiting them, making it a negative externality.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nSincerely,\nYour Friend\n\nWord Count: 488\nGrant, Peter. “Don’t Build That E-Commerce Warehouse in My Backyard, More Communities Say.” The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones & Company, 20 Feb. 2024, www.wsj.com/business/logistics/dont-build-that-e-commerce-warehouse-in-my-backyard-more-communities-say-5e35625a. \n",

      "essay": "Dr. Dudley \nEcon 101 \n26 March 2024 \nWriting Assignment #3: Market Failure\nDear Friend, \nI know you asked for help understanding a market failure, so I’m here to help! A market failure occurs when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome that maximizes total surplus, this is without government intervention of course. As a result, society’s total net gain isn’t maximized because the efficient amount isn’t met. Market failure can be measured through the following: externalities, artificially scarce resources, common resources, and even public goods. Diving deeper into externalities there are two types: positive and negative. Positive externalities result when too little is produced and the marginal social benefit is greater than the marginal social cost. Negative externalities result when too much is produced and marginal social cost is greater than marginal social benefit. As a result of externalities, third parties not involved in the original transaction of the goods or service will experience an external benefit or cost in the market, leading to inefficient outcomes. When referencing efficiency in the market, it refers to maximizing society’s total net gain or total surplus, where marginal benefit or the demand curve intersects marginal cost or the supply curve. It's also important to note, the market equilibrium fails to account for externalities. Since it does not generate as much total surplus as possible, this leads to a failure of social inefficiency. In order to achieve social efficiency, we should consider the externalities and confirm that market outcomes correspond to socially optimal quantities. \nTo clearly illustrate the concept of a market failure, let’s look at a real world example from The Washington Post, ‘How air pollution prevents pollinators from finding their flowers,’ addresses the negative externality of air pollution by emissions from coal plants and the negative impact of over polluting the air. The market involved is the mining industry that includes coal plants which over produces NO3, a potent pollutant, from their emissions of production and is released into the air. The overproduction of NO3 degrades certain scent chemicals necessary for moths in finding their flowers during bloom at night. This has led to a decline in moths’ ability to pollinate flowers, negatively impacting the plant community. A researcher notes as a result of the presence of NO3 that “wild moth visitation dropped by about 70 percent” (Grandoni). Aware of this negative externality, if the market fails to account for this, it can lead to a failure of social efficiency because the producers of NO3 are only considering the marginal private cost of their emissions without considering the marginal social cost. The external marginal cost includes the decline of moths’ ability to pollinate resulting in the negative impact on the plant community. This failure creates a new market equilibrium where the producer surplus increases and consumer surplus diminishes because producers marginal cost shift left and society experiences deadweight loss. In this situation, the overproduction of NO3 leads to the experienced external cost of air pollution, decline of moths ability to pollinate, and potential risks to the plant community. \n\nWord count: 495\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited \nGrandoni, Dino. “How Air Pollution Prevents Pollinators from Finding Their Flowers.” Washington Post, 8 Feb. 2024, www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/08/air-pollution-pollinator-moths/.\n\n\n\n",

I have been\ntold that you are dealing with your family emergency, but you are still trying to keep up with the\ncourse material. Because of this, I would be more than willing to help you understand market\nfailure which we covered in class.\nIn simple terms, market failure happens when there is an inefficient distribution of goods\nand services within a market, resulting in an inefficient use of resources and negative\nconsequences for the community. A number of factors, including the existence of externalities,\ninsufficient supply of public goods, and improper use of shared resources, may contribute to\nthis. Let's look at a recent Earth.org article titled \"Fast Fashion's Detrimental Effect on the\nEnvironment\" to demonstrate this idea. The essay emphasizes how fast fashion has a negative\nimpact on the environment and society, paying special attention to well-known stores like Zara,\nForever 21, and H&M.\nOne clear indicator of market failure is the fast fashion industry's incapacity to accept the\nenvironmental costs associated with its production methods. Economists refer to these\noutcomes as negative externalities. When a good is produced or consumed and expenses are\npaid for by individuals not directly involved in the transaction, this is known as a negative\nexternality. The prices of fast fashion items do not account for the full costs of production, which\ninclude worker exploitation in countries where wages are low and pollution from textile dyeing\nand production of clothes.\nCustomers are consequently not entirely aware of the social and environmental effects\nof their purchases. Overconsumption brought on by misinformation would increase our marginal\ncost. Fast fashion may offer affordable and stylish goods to consumers, but it also has negative\neffects which impact society as a whole, like social injustice and harm to the environment.\nIn conclusion, the fast fashion industry is an excellent illustration of how negative\nexternalities cause market failure. In the end, overconsumption, resource depletion, pollution,\nand labor exploitation hurt the environment and society as a whole when the environmental and\nsocial costs of production are overlooked.\nI really hope this explanation is able to help clarify the concept of market failure for you.\nPlease don't hesitate to get in touch if you need more help or if you have additional questions.\nNever forget that we are all here to support you at this difficult period, no matter what.\nT ake care,\nConcerned Classmate\nWord Count: [413]",

      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nHey there! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share something about the market that I recently\nlearned in my economics class, about market failure, which we've been discussing. It might seem\na bit tricky at first, but it’s really important to know about it. I found an article that could help\nclear things up.\nI stumbled upon an article in The New Y ork Times that talks about the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) making rules on industrial particles, a harmful type of air pollution. Basically\nmarket failure occurs when the distribution of goods and services by a market isn't efficient and\nleads to impacts on society. In this scenario, there's a market failure in air quality due to pollution\ncausing effects beyond what's accounted for.\nFine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5 is released by factories, power plants and other\nindustries. These tiny particles can cause health problems, like premature mortality and increased\nhospital admissions for heart or lung causes. The EPAs move to tighten regulations that aim to\ntackle these impacts by reducing the amount of PM 2.5 in the air.\nThe article points out conflicting interests in play. Business groups argue that stricter regulations\nmight raise costs and harm manufacturing jobs. This opposition shows a case of market failure,\nwhere the private production costs don't fully represent the costs linked to pollution like\nhealthcare expenses and lost productivity due to illness. They are only thinking about their\nbusiness and how it can harm them financially. However, there is much more to it than just some\nfinancial problems. Workers and even people of the public are taking in these harmful effects that\ncan lead to emergency room visits and other costs regarding health. Additionally certain\nindustries, such as cement manufacturers anticipate difficulties in meeting the rules, which could\nresult in job cuts and reduced production. This highlights the complexity of addressing market\nfailure because regulations aimed at benefiting society might have effects on economic sectors.\nIn essence, this article offers a real world illustration of how market failure emerges in\nregulation. By grasping concepts, like externalities and the role of government intervention, we\ncan better understand the intricacies of making decisions in a society where individual actions\naffect others' well being.\nI hope this explanation clarifies the concept of market failure for you!

I'm here to help you understand the concept of market failure, with the\nhelp of a recent news article that I have read.\nMarket failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is inefficient,\nleading to a misallocation of resources. In easier terms, it's when the market fails to produce the\nsocially optimal quantity of a good or service. At the heart of market failures are externalities,\nwhich play a pivotal role in causing these inefficiencies. Externalities are defined as the costs or\nbenefits incurred or received by third parties who are not directly involved in a transaction or\neconomic activity, leading to outcomes that do not reflect the true cost or value of the goods or\nservices involved. These can be positive, where benefits extend to others (like education or\npublic vaccination programs), or negative, where costs are imposed on others (such as pollution\nor noise from a factory affecting nearby residents).\nI found an article from The Washington Post titled \"Air pollution tied to signs of Alzheimer’s in\nbrain tissue, study finds\" published on February 23, 2024, which provides a clear example of\nmarket failure due to externalities. In the article, researchers discovered that inhaling higher\nconcentrations of airborne particulates, specifically those from traffic-related air pollution,\nincreases the likelihood of developing signs of Alzheimer's disease. This article highlights the\nfailure of the market to account for the true costs of pollution. The producers and consumers of\ngoods and services that contribute to air pollution do not bear the full cost of the negative\nexternalities they impose on society. As a result, there is overconsumption of goods and services\nthat contribute to pollution, leading to adverse health outcomes like Alzheimer's disease. To\ncorrect the inefficiency, the government can impose taxation, regulation, or other means designed\nto reduce consumption of the good causing pollution.\nI hope this example helps clarify the concept of market failure for you. Understanding market\nfailure is essential for recognizing the limitations of free markets and the role of government in\npromoting economic efficiency and societal welfare. By identifying and correcting market\nfailures, governments can help ensure that the allocation of resources more closely aligns with\nthe social optimum, thereby improving the overall welfare of society.\nPlease reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance with your coursework.\nWarm regards,\nCelina St. Vil\n1.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well. I hear you are having trouble with the concept of market\nfailure, but don’t worry I can help break it down for you.\nMarket failure, simply put, is when the market is not maximizing total surplus. In other\nwords, it occurs when the allocation of goods and services is not efficient. Market failures can\noccur for many reasons including externalities. Externalities are unintended consequences of\neconomic activities that have an external effect on the market. They can be either positive or\nnegative, but both lead to market failure. For positive externalities, the market quantity is lower\nthan the efficiency quantity and vice versa for negative externalities. To more clearly illustrate\nthis, I will provide an example of a recent market failure due to a negative externality.\nOne of the most common negative externalities is air pollution. When power plants\noperate, pollution is unaccounted for and leads to unwanted consequences including the\nincreased risk of lung cancer and death for people close to the power plants. According to a New\nY ork Times article, “Michael S. Regan, the E.P .A. administrator, has said the new rule would\nprevent an estimated 4,500 premature deaths every year, as well as 290,000 lost workdays\nbecause of illness” (Freidman). The “new rule” is an action to tighten limits on the emission of\ndeadly air pollutants including PM 2.5 (Friedman).The deaths and lost workdays are proof of the\nmarket operating over the efficient quantity and the price of the power plants’ goods being too\nhigh. Due to the external cost that air pollution causes, the efficient quantity for power produced\nby these plants is at a higher price and lower quantity than the current market quantity. There are\nways to fix negative externalities, but they require government action for the most part. In the\narticle I referred to earlier, the government intends to place quotas on the amount of pollutants\nthat can be produced, leading to a lower quantity and higher price which pushes the quantity\nfrom market quantity to the efficient quantity.\nAlthough enforcing legislation to fix market failure seems like it would always be the\nbest option, introducing quotas and taxes on negative externalities like air pollution can place\nmany people out of jobs. In the article by Freidman, Russel Coleman, Kentucky’s attorney\ngeneral was quoted as saying, “This rule will drive jobs and investment out of Kentucky and\noverseas, leaving hardworking families to pay the price”(Friedman). Fixing externalities and\nmarket failures in general is not an easy task because pushing the market quantity to the efficient\nquantity always has a transactional cost.\nIn short, a market failure is when the market is not maximizing total surplus and it is\ncaused by an external force such as externalities, public goods, or common resources. Market\nfailure is difficult to fix but it is usually fixed by taxes, quotas, or licenses.\nFrom,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 492\nWorks Cited:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=1",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failure describes a scenario in which goods and services in the market are not\ndistributed evenly. This results in inefficiencies in supply and demand; efficiency is required to\nmaximize total surplus or total net gain. At an efficient quantity, social marginal benefit and\nsocial marginal cost intersect. When quantity is not efficient, though, the market will be in a state\nof disequilibrium. Market failures are often influenced by externality, public goods, common\nresources, and artificially scarce goods. Inefficiencies in the market are identified as market\nfailures when government intervention is not taken into account and the state of disequilibrium is\na direct result of the market failing to be efficient.\nOne variety of market failure, externality, occurs when a third party receives some variety\nof additional, unintended benefit or cost outside of the good or service being produced. Negative\nexternalities involve the imposition of an additional cost upon a third party– this may also be\ndescribed as an external cost. External costs may include air pollution and other environmental\nissues which may be attributed to corporations. In the context of market equilibrium, negative\nexternalities involve an excess in supply compared to what is considered efficient. Positive\nexternalities, on the other hand, contrast with negative externalities because there is an\ninsufficient quantity of goods to meet demand in an efficient manner. Positive externalities are\nbenefits imposed on a third party; corporations receive no compensation for these external\nbenefits. An example of an external benefit widely utilized is vaccination.\nExternalities are prevalent in the market and have the potential to greatly influence\nsociety. One article published by Amnesty International, “United States: Lives devastated and\nhuman rights sacrificed by fossil fuel-related pollution from petrochemical plants in Texas and\nLouisiana”, discusses the harms associated with the fossil fuel industry and petrochemical plants.\nFossil fuel facilities and petrochemical plants derive chemicals from fossil fuels which they use\nto “\nmanufacture plastics, fertilizers, pesticides and other products” (Amnesty International,\n2024). While the materials produced by the fossil fuel are necessary and important, the process\nof their production is harmful to the environment. Toxic chemicals from petrochemical plants are\noften released into the atmosphere, contaminating the air. These chemicals elevate the quantity of\nground level ozone and create harmful smog which can cause respiratory diseases.\nThe government may intervene in an effort to rectify this negative externality.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope everything is okay, and of course, I would love to help you understand market\nfailure. Market failure occurs when the market doesn't produce at an eﬃcient quantity or allocate\nresources correctly, which result in outcomes that aren't beneficial to society. As you know from\npast lectures, in a perfectly functioning market, prices reflect both the costs of production and\nwhat consumers are willing to pay, leading to an equilibrium where supply meets demand.\nHowever, various factors can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to market failure.\nOne significant aspect of market failure is negative externalities, which occur when\nsomeone's actions cause harm to others without compensating them for the damage. To illustrate\nthis concept with a real-world example, consider the recent EPA regulation targeting the\nreduction of soot emissions from manufacturers, utilities, and industry associations. These\nproducers of soot argue that following the regulation would increase costs for them and the\npublic, without adequately considering the environmental and health benefits. This disagreement\nhighlights the existence of hidden costs associated with soot emissions, such as health problems\nand environmental damage, which are not factored into market prices. These hidden costs are\nwhat lead to market failures. Soot emissions contribute to air pollution, leading to adverse health\neﬀects and environmental degradation. However, the full costs of these negative eﬀects are not\nborne by the companies emitting the soot( because they are only thinking of their private benefits\nthey are receiving). Instead, society as a whole bears the burden through health issues and\nenvironmental harm (which is the social cost everyone has to pay). This diﬀrence between the\ncosts imposed by soot emissions and the prices set by the market represents a market failure, as it\nfails to account for the true societal costs.\nThe EPA regulation goal is to address this market failure by internalizing the external\ncosts of pollution. By imposing limits on soot emissions and requiring companies to invest in\ncleaner technologies, the regulation incentivizes firms to reduce their environmental impact and\npromote public health. So the Government has to intervene because in this case, the free market\nalone doesn't lead to eﬃcient outcomes in protecting public health and the environment from\nharmful pollutants.\nIn summary, the opposition to the EPA's soot regulation illustrates market failure due to\nnegative externalities, highlighting the need for government intervention to correct these issues\nand promote the welfare of society. I hope this example sheds light on the concept of market\nfailure for you. If you need further explanation or have any questions, feel free to reach out. Take\ncare, and let me know how else I can assist you during this time.\nWith love,\nY our friend.\nWc: 439\nCitation: The New Y ork Times. (2024, March 6). Manufacturers and 24 States Sue E.P .A.

      "essay": "To: Friend\nSubject: ECON 101 Market Failure and Externalities\nDear Friend,\nI am writing to you to clarify the economic concept of market failure. As discussed in class, a\nmarket failure occurs when “the individual pursuit of one’s own interest, instead of promoting\nthe interests of society as a whole, actually makes society worse off” (Krugman). This can occur\ndue to positive externalities, represented by external marginal benefits, or negative externalities,\nrepresented by external marginal costs. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost an\nindividual or firm imposes on others and a positive externality causes a benefit to a third party\nwhen a good is produced or consumed. Due to its inability to consider the externality, the market\nequilibrium fails to maximize total surplus, and therefore the market fails to be efficient\n(Dudley). With a positive externality, the market equilibrium results in too few units of the good\ncompared to the efficient level while with a negative externality, the market equilibrium results\nin too many units of the good compared to the efficient level.\nOne prime example of market failure is in an article from Time that discusses the water shortage\ncrisis in the Arabian Gulf region. It emphasizes the challenges faced by the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil (GCC) countries in rationing their water resources and the environmental consequences\nof their dependence on desalination processes. The saltwater Gulf is considered a common\nresource because it is rival and non-excludable. The water from the gulf is non-excludable\nbecause people who do not pay cannot be prevented from consuming it and rival in consumption\nmeaning the same unit of water cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time.\nReliance on this resource raises concerns due to pollution from desalination.\nThis article provides an example of market failure seeing that reliance on desalination as a\nsolution to the water scarcity issue results in unsustainable resource use, greenhouse gas\nemissions, and environmental deterioration. This is a negative externality since the production of\ndesalinized water imposes an indirect cost on society due to pollution, and leads to an inefficient\nallocation of resources. Water scarcity resulting from overconsumption is another market failure\nmentioned in the article relating to a common resource. According to the article, “By 2050, the\nworldwide emissions from desalination is expected to reach 0.4 billion tons of CO2 equivalents\nper year” (Hakimdavar). This represents a cost to society that is not reflected in the market price\nand could incur increased healthcare costs for those impacted by the harmful side effects of\npollution in the environment. In addition to CO2, brine is a byproduct of the desalinization\nprocess, and is disposed of back into the sea, which “decreases oxygen levels in the water,\nsuffocating marine life on the seafloor” (Hakimdavar). This impact on marine ecosystems costs\nsociety, seeing that biodiversity decreases. The government could attempt to solve this negative\nexternality by implementing a tax on CO2 emissions or issuing tradeable emission permits that\nallow limited quantities of pollutants. This would encourage companies to reduce emissions and\nadopt cleaner desalinization technologies.\nSincerely,\nY our classmate\nWord count: 499\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities.” 22 March 2024, University of Michigan, MI.

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI understand that you are confused with the concept of market failure. I am confident that\nI can explain it to you using a real life example so that it is easier to understand!\nIn general terms, market failure can be defined as an economic situation in which there is\nan inefficient distribution of goods in the free market. In simple terms, consumer demand is not\nequal to consumer supply, and this is due to an individual's pursuit of their own interests harming\nsociety as a whole. It’s important to keep in mind that there are four main types of market failure,\nincluding externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. While I\nrecommend knowing all of these, it may be easier to understand by simply focusing on one.\nExternalities are the easiest to understand. Essentially, externalities are a combination of\nan external cost (an uncompensated cost that an individual imposes on others, or negative\nexternality) and external benefits (a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without\nreceiving compensation, or positive externality).\nAlthough these concepts may seem difficult to comprehend, we see examples of\nexternalities in everyday life. Pollution is the most prominent example of a negative externality.\nThe article “We’re All Climate Economists Now” by Lydia Depillis for the New York\nTimes discusses climate change as a classic example of a negative externality, where the actions\nof individuals and firms result in costs borne by society as a whole. The impact of natural\ndisasters on various aspects of life such as mortgage risk, railway safety, and payday loans\ndemonstrates how climate change imposes costs on economic activities beyond those directly\ninvolved in producing greenhouse gasses, meaning how each and every one of us are suffering\neconomically from the effects of climate change. Though we as individuals are not the largest\ncontributors to pollution (large corporations/manufacturers are the true culprits), it's crucial to\nrecognize that our collective actions, when summed up, do contribute significantly to the\nproblem. This example illustrates how market failure occurs when the true costs of production,\nsuch as environmental damage, are not accounted for in the prices of goods and services.\nImagine a factory producing phones. The cost of producing each phone includes the\nmaterials, wage, and other direct expenses. However, if the factory emits pollutants during\nproduction, causing harm to nearby farms or communities, these costs are not factored into the\nprice of the phone. As a result, consumers pay less for the phones than the true cost of\nproduction, and the factory has little incentive to reduce pollution.\nThis misallocation of resources exemplifies market failure. In an ideal market, prices\nwould reflect all costs, including externalities, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.\nHowever, in reality, markets often fail to account for these external costs and benefits, leading to\noutcomes that are not in the best interest of society as a whole.\nHopefully this example has helped you understand market failure better. Let me know if\nyou have questions.\nSincerely,\nY our friend.\nWord count: 500\nWork Cited\nDepillis, Lydia. “‘We’re All Climate Economists Now.’” The New York Times, The New Y ork\nTimes, 23 Jan. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/economy/climate-change-economics.html\n.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\n\tCurrently, in ECON 101 we are discussing the topic of market failure including how and why a market fails. Market failure is when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, which would be where total surplus is maximized, even when the market has reached an equilibrium.  It is important to note that market failure can only occur when there are no government interventions that could be dictating market outcomes. With this information, you can calculate market failure by finding the difference between the total surplus at the market equilibrium and total surplus at the efficient point (which is found using the marginal analysis skills we already know, where marginal benefit intersects with marginal cost) which would provide you the dead weight loss or magnitude of the market failure. One reason market failure may occur is because of externalities because there are uncompensated costs (when negative) or external benefits (when positive) that the market does not consider or internalize thus making the efficient point differ from the equilibrium point. When considering negative externalities, the external cost is added to marginal cost (supply curve) to create a new social marginal cost curve that results in an efficient quantity that is less than the market quantity. For positive externalities, the external benefit is added to marginal benefit (demand curve) to create a new social marginal benefit curve that results in an efficient quantity that is greater than the market quantity. A good example of how an externality can create a market failure is when we examine the automobile market and Volkswagen’s plans to recapitalize lost market shares in the US through their iconic line of vehicles adapted to be electric. This example is relevant as we saw their popular commercial at the Superbowl and they have made headlines like in the attached New York Times article, “Volkswagen Leans on Electric Vehicles and Nostalgia to Grow in U.S.” (Ewing), describing these plans. Volkswagen’s projected increases in electric vehicle sales have positive externalities on society by decreasing carbon emissions and polluting less which benefits even those not involved in Volkswagen transactions with a cleaner environment, better health, etc. The resulting total external benefit would consequently increase social marginal benefit beyond the market’s current marginal benefit and would cause an overall increase in society’s total surplus. This increase in society's total surplus would surpass the market equilibrium’s total surplus, resulting in a market failure as the market equilibrium produces too few units compared to the efficient level and does not maximize society’s total surplus once you consider the extra benefit provided to society from the positive externality.  Thus, despite the added benefit to society from the increase in electric vehicles, the market fails due to the positive externalities as it is not functioning at the most efficient level. This example clarifies that market failure has to do with achieving efficiency not whether the cause of the failure such as externalities hurt or benefit (like in this case) society. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nYour Friend \n\n493\n\nEwing, Jack. “Volkswagen Leans on Electric Vehicles and Nostalgia to Grow in U.S.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 20 Feb. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/business/vw-electric-vehicles-us.html.\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \nI hope all is well despite everything going on. I see you are struggling to understand market failure, but don't worry, I found an article to help you understand some things a bit better. \nBefore we take a look at the article, it is important that you understand the basics. Market failure is when the market does not meet an efficient outcome. Essentially, the market is not allocating resources for the optimal outcome. When supply and demand are equal, a market is efficient. However, there are some factors that can affect market efficiency, which leads to market failure.\nOne common market failure, and the one we will be focusing on is externalities. Investopedia defines an externality as, “a cost or benefit that is caused by one party but financially incurred or received by another” (Kenton 2024). There are two types of externalities, positive and negative. A positive externality is a benefit incurred by a third party. A negative externality, on the other hand, is a cost incurred by the third party. The most common example of a negative externality is the one discussed in the article, “We Are All Climate Economists Now.”\nThe New York Times Article by Lydia DePillis discusses the growing focus on climate change by economists, especially changes caused by carbon emissions. DePillis mentions how carbon emissions and climate change are negative externalities. Pollution is always an example of a negative externality because other people not involved in polluting will reap the negative effects of other people's pollution. The article discusses the externality by explaining that the impacts of carbon emissions are not factored into market prices, and there is an insufficient resource allocation that is harmful to the environment. They are negative externalities because the carbon emissions imposed by a factory can affect the health or air quality of nearby residents  \nIn order to try to “fix” a negative externality the government may impose a tax on the polluter, quotas, and require permits. According to Lydia DePillis, “A solution preferred by economists, setting a cap on carbon emissions and creating a market for trading permits…” This would be an example of the government imposing a quota on the pollution. These government interventions are meant to make it more costly for individuals to pollute, which will hopefully incentivize them to adopt cleaner practices.\nI hope my description of market failure and example of externalities make you feel more confident before you return to class.

      "essay": "Hey Friend,\nI hope everything is well. I’m more than happy to explain market failures, specifically\nexternalities, to you. If there’s anything else I can do, please let me know!\nA market failure occurs when the market fails to produce an efficient outcome. But that’s very\nbroad, so what more specifically does that mean? We know that naturally, the market will\nproduce at a price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied. This price usually\nmaximizes total surplus. However, the market fails when individual producers and consumers\ndon’t account for the benefit or harm the market has on other people. This additional benefit or\nharm is called an externality and can be represented by a new curve on the classic\nsupply/demand graph.\nWhen we have an external cost to others, the marginal social cost of the good will be higher than\nthe private cost, meaning that there will be a marginal social cost left of the private supply curve.\nWe should produce at the price and quantity where MSC meets demand. When we have an\nexternal benefit to others, the marginal social benefit of the good will be higher than the private\nbenefit, meaning that there will be a marginal social benefit right of the private demand curve.\nWe should produce at the price and quantity where MSB meets supply.\nWhether it is a benefit or cost imposed on society, there is a different quantity and price at which\ntotal surplus is maximized, and this should be where the market produces. Still, it doesn’t\nbecause the affected third parties don’t get a say in the transaction. Commonly, we use vaccines\nand smoking as examples of this benefit and harm (assuming the markets are unregulated). If I\nget a vaccine, I can no longer pass the disease to you. Y ou benefit, but I don’t think about your\nbenefit when I get the vaccine. Thus, society doesn’t use enough vaccines. Conversely, if I\nsmoke, I negatively impact your health. Y ou’re harmed, but I don’t think about this when I\nsmoke. Thus, society smokes too much.\nFor a real-world example, look at this article from the New York Times. It describes new\nregulations the EPA implemented for chemical storage in areas prone to natural disasters\n(Tabuchi). The cost imposed on communities with chemical spills hasn’t been accounted for in\nthis market (Tabuchi). The article says over 130 million people could be affected in a worst-case\nscenario (Tabuchi). However, storers and buyers of chemicals don’t consider this external cost.\nThe marginal social cost curve of storing chemicals outside is left of the private cost curve,\nmeaning that to maximize total surplus, we should store fewer chemicals outside and at a higher\nprice. This externality is why the EPA has imposed these regulations in the market - to raise the\nprivate cost of storing chemicals and hopefully bring it in line with the marginal social cost.\nI can’t wait to see you back on campus!

To explain this topic to you I have found a recent article that was published on February 15, 2024, that is called “Deep in the Amazon Rainforest, a Bucket List Trip with a Thoughtful Mission” by Tom Downey. This article talks all about market failure – more specifically the problem of deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest. \nThe article teaches us about the environmental degradation that exists in the city in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest (Manaus, Brazil). This Wall Street Journal article brings to light the extent to which the damage to the environment has increased as well as neglect regarding those effects. Widespread deforestation takes a negative toll on the biodiversity and the stability, in an ecological sense, of the Amazon Rainforest. \nThis can be seen as an imbalance between the distribution of services and goods. The free-market system is unable to allocate resources efficiently. This market failure is deemed to be a negative externality because there are costs to society that are incurred by people/businesses that are not typically reflected in market prices. A logging company in Manaus can prioritize making money over preserving the biodiversity of the ecosystem by clearing forests with little regard for the terrible consequences. They can rejoice in the gains, financially, from wood sales and choose to neglect the negative consequences that occur such as habitat loss, release of stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and unstable stability in the ecosystem. All of these conditions can worsen the effects of climate change. Despite these major negative externalities, many of these logging companies won’t take personal accountability, which transfers this burden onto our society. It is imperative to take externalities into account when making economic decisions. The short-term profit is not worth the expense that is associated with long-term sustainability. \nThe Amazon Rainforest is an example of how natural resources are public goods and common resources. The rainforest is a public good as it does help society through carbon sequestration and helps regulate the climate regardless of individual contributions. However, it also has limited resources like land for timber and farming which can be competitive and subjected to overexploitation in the lack of management as it is a shared resource. \nMarket failure in the Amazon Rainforest can be tackled in many ways. You can implement stricter legislation against the issue of deforestation and make incentives about using sustainable land-use practices. The deforestation crisis in the Amazon Rainforest underscores the consequences of market failure and the efforts that need to be made urgently to preserve the biodiversity of our ecosystem. \nFrom, \nYour friend\n\nWord Count: 454\nArticle: https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/amazon-rainforest-preservation-travel-fa6593e5 \n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure Explanation\nHey Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well despite the unexpected family emergency. During your\nabsence, we covered market failure in Econ. I am writing to you to explain it through an article\nthat I found: “Moderna Looks to Pare R&D Spending Even as It Pivots From Covid V accines”.\nMarket failure occurs when the free market doesn’t produce the best outcome for society\nor in other words is inefficient. One common reason for market failure is the presence of\nexternalities, which are unintended side effects of economic activities that affect parties not\ndirectly involved in the transaction. Specifically, positive externalities occur when the benefits of\na good or service translate into third parties that are not directly involved in the market.\nIn the context of this article, Moderna, a biotechnology company has decided to expand\nits research and development efforts to other vaccines beyond COVID-19, which presents a clear\nexample of a positive externality. If one gets a vaccine, not only are they more immune to the\ndisease, it helps others who aren’t vaccinated as they are less likely to spread it to those people as\nwell. This spillover into the workforce as a healthier population results in a more productive\nworkforce and lower absenteeism due to illness, which can lead to a more robust economy and\nincrease productivity, positively impacting not only individuals but also businesses and the\neconomy as a whole.\nBut despite these positive externalities associated with Moderna’s vaccine research\nexpansion, the free market does not naturally consider these benefits which leads to the market\nequilibrium resulting in underproducing vaccines for diseases because the private benefits to\nModerna do not capture the full societal benefits generated by this expansion of research and\ndevelopment. For example, if the consumer's marginal benefit or the conventional demand is $10\nless than the social marginal benefit, the external marginal benefit gained from Moderna’s efforts\nwould be $10.\nAs a result, government intervention or other policy measures may be critical to address\nthis market failure and ensure the optimal allocation of resources to Moderna’s research and\ndevelopment in vaccines. The most obvious example of this would be a government subsidy\nwhich could incentivize Moderna and similar companies to invest in research and development\nfor vaccines that provide positive externalities to society.\nIn summary, market failure involves situations where the market does not account for all\nthe costs and benefits associated with economic activities. In the case of vaccine research,\npositive externalities lead to the underproduction of the vaccines, and corrective policies such as\nvaccine subsidies are necessary to rectify this market failure. I hope my explanation and the\nusage of the article helps you grasp the concept of market failure.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope all is well. I know you're having trouble understanding the concept of market\nfailure, and I'm here to guide you using recent examples in the news. New Y ork Times article\ntitled \"Supreme Court Seems Ready to Block a Biden Plan on Air Pollution,\" can help you\nunderstand more about market failures and its application to our everyday lives. For starters, let's\ndefine what it means for a market to fail. The failure of a market is the consequence of inefficient\nresource allocation, which is brought about by the distribution of commodities and services in a\nfree market. Some of the factors that contribute to this issue include externalities, shared\nresources, public goods, and things that are artificially scarce. It is time to put this into practice in\nrespect to the article. The \"good neighbor\" plan, which is the name of the project that the Biden\nadministration is implementing to reduce air pollution that crosses state lines, is mentioned in the\narticle. According to this idea, manufacturing and power plants situated in states located in the\nWestern and Midwestern regions will be responsible for reducing the amount of ozone pollution\nthat is harming Eastern regions. In spite of this, the Supreme Court can put a temporary hold on\nthis proposal. Using the idea of externalities, this situation serves as an example of market\nfailure. When a good is produced or consumed, externalities happen when they have an impact\non a party not directly involved in the transaction. In this instance, the air quality and general\nhealth of people living in nearby states are impacted by the pollution produced by factories and\npower plants in one state. Asthma, lung disease, and premature death are health problems\nbrought on by these toxic pollutants, which have negative externalities. The reason for this\nfailure is that the manufacturers and power plants, who are the market participants, do not fully\nsuffer the consequences of their activities since they do not take into account the harm that they\nbring to people in other states. If action is not taken, they might keep producing pollutants above\nwhat society considers to be acceptable, which would have inefficient effects. The \"good\nneighbor\" proposal put forth by the Biden administration aims to overcome this market failing by\nenforcing pollution emission laws. The idea may be blocked by the Supreme Court, which\nunderscores the difficulties and complications of managing externalities through government\naction.\nI hope you now have a better understanding of what I mean when I say \"market failure.\"\nBest,\nY our Friend",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope all is well. I am writing this email to help you better understand the complexities of\nmarket failure.\nMarket failure is an economic occurrence in which a system of free markets fails to allocate\nresources efficiently and does not maximize total surplus. Moreover, market failures typically\noccur when the price agreed upon in the market does not reflect the true social cost. It is\nimportant to note that market failure occurs when there is no government intervention. Market\nfailure can occur for various reasons, such as externalities or different types of goods.\nOne cause of market failure in a free market is Public Goods. Public goods are non-excludable,\nmeaning no price barrier prevents a person from using the goods. This, however, creates a\n“free-rider” problem in which individuals have no incentive to pay for the item and hope that\nothers will cover the cost for their benefit. This can lead to underfunding of the production of a\npublic good. Additionally, public goods are non-rival in consumption, which suggests that when\none individual uses a good, it does not diminish the availability of that good for other\nindividuals. This creates difficulties in setting a price that aligns with the value each person\nassigns to the good, potentially resulting in a breakdown of market efficiency.\nAnother type of market failure is a negative externality. Negative externalities occur when\nproducers and consumers in one market create uncompensated costs that are negatively imposed\non other markets. These are typically referred to as external costs in which an individual or firm\nmust pay for the actions of others. Negative externalities lower total surplus and can typically be\nsolved with taxation on the externality or the good itself.\nMany examples of negative externalities exist, especially in the automotive industry.\nSpecifically, the NY Post article, “ Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions, are worse for\nthe environment than gas-powered cars: study,” covers how electric vehicles release toxic\nparticles into the atmosphere, harming US citizens. Because EV cars weigh 30% more than\nregular cars, the brakes wear out faster and emit more toxins (Thaler). In this case, the negative\nexternalities refer to the environmental and health impacts caused by increased tire and brake\nwear emissions from electric vehicles, which are not factored into the vehicles' price or\noperation. This is a negative externality because these EV companies are creating heavier cars\nthat emit more toxins without accounting for the marginal social cost. The usage of electric\nvehicles is resulting in human exposure to toxic air pollutants that can increase the risk of lethal\nhealth problems for Americans like asthma and heart disease. Manufacturers of cars that emit\npollution persist with their production activities, notwithstanding the associated societal costs,\ndriven by their focus on maximizing profits despite the consequences for others.\nI hope this explanation and examples better your understanding of market failure. If you have\nany more questions, feel free to reach out.\nBest,\nY our Friend\nThaler, Shannon. “Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions, are worse for the environment\nthan gas-powered cars: study.” New Y ork Post, 5 March 2024,\nhttps://nypost.com/2024/03/05/business/evs-release-more-toxic-emissions-are-worse-for-the-envi\nronment-study/.

      "essay": "Hello,\nI hope all is well with your family. Market failure is a complicated topic and it is understandable\nthat it might be difficult to get a handle on from afar. A market fails when another cost (or\nbenefit), known as an externality, is incurred by the market that is not accounted for.\nExternalities, both positive and negative, cause the equilibrium to be inefficient. We will further\nexamine this concept through pollution, a negative externality associated with almost every type\nof production. We will specifically investigate emissions from electric cars and their effect on the\nmarket for ?????, using the Wall Street Journal’s article, “Electric Cars Emit More Particulate\nPollution”, to which you will find a link at the end of this email.\nTo measure market failure, you must find where the social marginal benefit and social marginal\ncost curves intersect. A negative externality will increase the social marginal cost from the\nproducer marginal cost, so the efficient quantity in the market will be less than the equilibrium\nquantity, and the efficient price will be higher than the equilibrium price. One way to achieve\nefficiency in a failed market is for the government to intervene, whether through setting\nstandards of production, using Pigouvian taxes, by subsidizing, setting production quotas, or by\ncreating tradable permits. To correct a market with a negative externality, the best option is to use\na Pigouvian tax, whether on production or on the good. In the case of pollution, setting\nenvironmental standards and selling tradable permits are other viable solutions; subsidies are\ngenerally only used in markets with positive externalities.\nIn our example of car emissions, the state of California hopes to ban gasoline-powered car sales\nwithin the next 10 years. The market failure in this situation is the pollution created by electric\ncars through excessive tire wear due to the weight of the vehicle. Pollution is a negative\nexternality because it will negatively impact, or “cost”, those in society who are not a part of the\nelectric car market, therefore increasing the social marginal cost. Although California’s proposed\npolicy should target electric and gasoline-powered cars equally, placing a ban on the production\naltogether is not feasible for a market that is so large. California’s lawmakers must hire an\neconomist who can measure the market failure and find the efficient point in the market relevant\nto the equilibrium point. They must then decide whether they would like to set a production\nquota or create tradable permits that are equal to the efficient quantity, levy a tax on either the\nemissions or the vehicles themselves that is equal to the cost the pollution incurs, or to set\nenvironmental standards that regulate the amount of pollution emitted in a way that would bring\nthe market quantity of production to the efficient point.\nI hope this was helpful and that you are able to return to class soon.

      "essay": "3/24/2024\nMarket Failure information\nDear Friend,\nI hope this letter finds you well. I know we in the United States are in a chaotic time. We\nare experiencing an overwhelming time nationally with different societal problems and\ninefficiencies, but there is one in particular I wanted to explain to you- market failure. Market\nfailures tend to occur due to inefficiencies, which are often represented through negative\nexternalities. As we discussed earlier, in the global healthcare context, many hidden\ninefficiencies have prevented the market from reaching its maximum total surplus. A particular\narticle by the Wall Street Journal in 2023 provides a perfect example of this economic\nphenomenon by discussing pharmaceutical companies taking steps to become more sustainable\n(Butini, 2023).\nA negative externality occurs when one party's consumption of a good or service harms a\nthird party, though most likely benefitting the first and second parties. The article explains that\nthe external cost of making and supplying medicine is air pollution, which causes damage to our\nenvironment. However, this is despite the benefits derived from necessary medicines. So, this is\na market failure since pollution acts as a negative externality in the market for medicine,\npreventing the market from reaching efficiency. There are many ways to combat an externality;\nthe government may impose taxes or quotas on producers' pollution. When an unaccounted\nnegative externality is present in the market, it is unable to reach the maximum Total Surplus or\nmarket efficiency.\nThis was precisely the case in the pharmaceutical industry. As medicine is necessary for\nsurvival, it is difficult to regulate in this particular market, so few restrictions have been placed.\nConsequently, pharmaceutical companies have begun taking the initiative to become more\nsustainable. They are attempting to accomplish this by reducing supply chain emissions, given\nthe tremendous greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the production and consumption of\nmedicine.\nSince imposing regulations on this market is difficult, producers should attempt to\nminimize the problem internally, as improving the problem will only increase their total surplus.\nIn addition, improving these internal problems will only improve the safety and well-being of\ntheir employees, providing clean labs and safe practices for producing these drugs at such high\nand low temperatures. Another benefit of prioritizing sustainability is that it always allows\nproducers to combat price pressures as they work toward efficiency.\nIt is important to understand market failures as they are apparent everywhere.\nAcknowledging them and working to correct them will only benefit us as individuals. The very\nact of correcting these failures increases our Total Surplus, increasing Society's total net gain.\nI hope this was helpful!\nSincerely,\nY our friend and Economics enthusiast.\n\\\nWorks Cited\nButini, Cecilia. “Pro Take: Making Medicines Greener.” The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones &\nCompany, 24 Oct. 2024,\nwww.wsj.com/articles/pro-take-making-medicines-greener-966d720c?mod=Searchresults_pos8\n&page=1",

      "essay": "Student 1\nWriting Assignment 3: First Draft\nHi friend!\nMarket failures occur when (absent any government intervention) the market fails to\nreach its efficient outcome. As you know, this also means the market does not maximize total\nsurplus. The market can fail even at equilibrium, as that is not a guarantee that the market is at its\nefficient outcome/maximum total surplus. To understand the measure of a market failure, you\nneed to identify both the total surplus at market equilibrium and the efficient outcome and\nmeasure the deadweight loss between the two points. Market failures occur in many scenarios,\nincluding when an externality is present or sometimes when a good is classified as either a\npublic, common, artificially scarce, or private good. However, to simplify this concept for you, I\nwant to focus on one example of market failure here—externalities. These are phenomena that\nhave effects, either positive or negative, on a third party outside the market.\nA great example of market failure can be seen in Michael Buschbacher and Taylor\nMyers’s recent Wall Street Journal article “Electric cars emit more particulate pollution.” The\nauthors discuss the proposed ban on gasoline-powered vehicles in California and the unintended\nnegative effects such a ban will have on the environment. Buschbacher and Myers show that\nelectric vehicles are actually responsible for more particulate pollution, which they define as\n“airborne particles like dust, dirt, and soot,” than gasoline-powered vehicles. California currently\nclassifies these electric vehicles as “zero emission,” but they still contribute to pollution as\nelectricity itself is a cause of pollution and the vehicles’ tires wear down quickly and emit more\nparticulate pollution as a result.\nStudent 2\nHere, there is a negative externality in the form of the unintended increased pollution that\na ban on gasoline-powered cars will have on the environment. This ban has a negative side effect\non a third party—every person in society that breathes the polluted air—that is not part of the\nmarket (the consumers and producers of the electronic vehicles), so it is considered a negative\nexternality.\nThis is a very clear example of a market failure. Because the market fails to account for\nthe electronic vehicles’ effect on society, it fails to reach the efficient outcome, which would\naccount for the costs that the EVs would have on the market. Understanding that the current\noutcome is not efficient is important because it highlights how many EVs producers should make\nand consumers should buy, and therefore can help the government impose policies to direct the\nmarket to a more efficient outcome and eliminate the negative effects on society. Here, they\nwould probably tax the production of the EVs so there would be less EVs on the market and\ntherefore less people would be driving EVs that can pollute the environment.\nIn summary, market failures occur when the market fails to reach its efficient outcome\nand account for the effects it may have on the rest of society.\nThank you for your time!\nStudent 3\nWorks Cited\nBuschbacher, M., & Myers, T.

      "essay": "My Dearest Friend,\nI’m so sorry to hear about your unexpected family emergency, and I can one hundred\npercent help further explain market failure to you. To start, it’s best to define market failure. In\nclass we defined market failure as something that occurs when the market fails to reach its\nefficient outcome even when its at equilibrium. It’s important to note that market failure\nspecifically occurs without any intervention, including the government. Due to the market\nequilibriums inability to account for externalities, these are what lead to market failure. There are\ntwo types of externalities: positive adn negative. A negative externality is when there is a cost\nthat one firm/individual imposes on others, that is not accounted for. An example of this, which I\nwill further discuss in the chosen article, is pollution. On a graph a negative externality would\nimpact the supply curve, and move to the left. This would mean that the quantity would decrease\nwhile the price increases. As for a positive externality, this is when a firm/individual gains\nsomething from others while not receiving compensation. It’s more commonly known as an\nexternal benefit. An example would be a neighbors nice yard or vaccinations. On a graph, a\npositive externality would cause a rightward shift on the demand curve. This means that both the\nquantity and price of that good would increase as a result.\nIn order to help you better understand i’ve linked a news article that provides an excellent\nexample of negative externalities and market failure.1 The New Y ork Times just recently reported\non the recent suing of the E.P .A due to their new production quota on deadly pollution that is\nbeing emitted from different industrial companies across the U.S. This article highlights both a\nnegative externality (pollution), and a way the government supresses the externality. The\npollution being emitted from these companies was causing too much harm to other comanies,\nresulting in market failure. Not to mention that many negative externalities, such as this one, are\nbecause a company wants to maximize supply at any cost, including the mass exertion of\npollution. In response to this, the E.P .A implemented this law essentially saying that companies\ncannot produce more than a certain amount of pollutants in the air (production quota). This\narticle perfectly exemplifies the relationship between government intervention and market\nfailure.\nI hope that this email found you well and aided in your understanding of market failure.\nLet me know if there is anything else you need frome me!\nBest,\nKiley Chavez\n1 Friedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A. over New Limits on Deadly Pollution.” The\nNew York Times, The New Y ork Times, 6 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\n\tI am writing to explain to you what exactly is market failure. Market failure is a term used when a market equilibrium is not at efficiency. Some examples are, externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. Efficiency occurs when total surplus is maximized in the market. Market equilibrium only takes into account consumer and producer surplus and not the impact it may have on the broader society or a 3rd party, while efficiency does. When there is inefficiency in a market, this will cause something called deadweight loss. Deadweight loss is a measure of the reduction in total surplus from the efficient outcome. When one of these examples are present in the market, causing a market failure, there are implementations that can be put into place to guide the market to where it should be, eliminating the deadweight loss, making society better off. For externalities, there are two types, positive and negative externalities. Positive externality makes a 3rd party not involved in the producing or consuming better off, for example flu shots. Something that helps the deadweight loss in this scenario would be to give out subsidies. Negative externality makes a 3rd party not involved, worse off, for example pollution. A way to help with this situation would be taxes, permits, and standards. For the different kinds of goods, the same tactics used for negative externalities are also what would be used in this case. \n\tThe article that I read that had an example of a market failure is titled “The U.S. Is Spoiled by Cheap Canadian Oil. That’s About to Change.” In this article the market failure present is common goods, being the gas. Gas is a common good because it is a rival in consumption meaning one person can use it at a time and it is non-excludable technically anyone has access to it, if they were to go into the ground and extract it. The article explains that the Midwest has been enjoying the cheap gas prices of Canadian oil, but now there will be a lot more buyers for the oil since there is a 715 mile long pipeline being built that will be able to travel the oil to further places like the West Coast and Asian economies. Since there are more buyers, higher demand, this will drive the price up. As for the market failure in this scenario, the social marginal costs will be higher than the private marginal cost of the resource. Meaning, the efficient quantity of consumption is lower than the market equilibrium and therefore results in a large pool of the remaining resource. Ways to manage this would be to make it excludable and assigning property rights, by Pigouvian taxes, or creating a tradable licenses system. Any of these would make the consumer and producers value the good more and treat it that way to not overuse the common resource. \n\tI hope this helps you understand market failure.\n\tSincerely, Your friend\nWord count: 495\n",

      "essay": "To: Y ourfriendhere@gmail.com\nSubject: Externalities Explained With an Example\nFrom: Econ 101 Student\nHi Friend,\nTo help you understand the concept of a market failure, first, it’s important to know what\nthe definition is. So, a market failure is a situation in which a market–left on its own–fails to\nallocate resources efficiently. It occurs when, without any kind of intervention, it does not\nmaximize total surplus, even in equilibrium. Basically, a market failure happens whenever the\nefficient price does not equal the market price of some good or service.\nThis situation, when efficient price doesn’t equal market price, can happen in multiple\nways, but one of the most fundamental catalysts is something called an externality. An\nexternality can be categorized into two classes: positive and negative externalities. However,\nbecause they are simply inverses of each other, all you need to know is one of the types, and then\nyou will understand the other. A negative externality, then, is an uncompensated cost that an\nindividual or firm imposes on others, also called an external cost. Because this external cost does\nnot, without intervention, inherently increase the producer's costs to make some good, it can be\nunaccounted for, and that is what leads to market failure.\nLet’s reference a recent news article, for example. On February 27, 2024, The Times\npublished a story about a British water treatment plant owned by Southern Water that killed\n2,000 fish after polluting a river. Southern Water, a producer in the clean water market, did not\ncare about the negative externality they imposed on the local fish market because they were not\nresponsible for any additional costs. Still, the externality existed, and so, as long as the external\ncost was not taken into account, the market price and quantity of clean water did not match the\nefficient price and quantity. Thus, there was a market failure.\nThere are a few ways that a failure such as this example can be resolved. In this case, the\ngovernment used something called a Pigouvian Tax to force Southern Water to pay for the\nexternal costs that they created by polluting the river. This tax is based on the quantity of\npollution that Southern Water emitted, and it amounted to a total of £330,000 levied on Southern\nWater. This tax implies that each murdered fish carried a price of £165. To figure out what this\nwould look like on a supply curve, we would need to know how many fish were killed by each\ngallon of water that Southern Water produced. Once we know that, we could multiply £165 by\nthat number of fish, add the external marginal cost onto the supply curve, get the Social Marginal\nCost curve, and then easily visualize the difference in total surplus between the market\nequilibrium and the efficient equilibrium.\nHopefully, this explanation was helpful. Let me know if you have any more questions. I’d\nbe happy to help.\nBest,\nEcon 101 Student\nWord Count: 474\nWorks Cited\nHumphries, Will. “Southern Water Fined £330,000 for Killing More than 2,000 Fish.” The Times\n& The Sunday Times: Breaking News & Today’ s Latest Headlines, The Times, 28 Feb.\n2024,\nwww.thetimes.co.uk/article/southern-water-fined-330000-for-killing-over-2000-river-fish\n-clean-it-up-p0m0brdz3.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\tI heard you have been struggling recently with the concept of market failures, so I wanted to reach out and help you better understand. The first and most basic thing to understand is that a market failure occurs when something happens in a market that makes the maximization of total surplus impossible, unless intervention takes place. This means the efficient outcome in the market is not reached. There are many things that can cause a market failure. Some common examples of market failure include externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. In this email, I will show you an example of a type of externality that caused a market failure in the market of plastic goods. The article comes from the New York Times, and it illustrates how plastic pollution has had negative effects on marine and human life. Plastics cannot biodegrade on their own, so with the increase in plastic production comes an increase in plastic pollution or microplastics. Microplastics have severely taken over the environment. They are in everything, but most concerningly, they are inside of us. There have been many cases of microplastics causing negative effects to many people. For example, those with high levels of microplastics throughout their body are more likely to be susceptible to heart attack, stroke, lung damage, or even death. Here is a link to the article so you can further investigate on you own: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=1 . \n\tThese negative effects of plastic production are the type of market failure known as a negative externality. Negative externalities occur when an unrelated third party of the market incurs an uncompensated cost. This third party is not directly involved in the market (is not a consumer of producer), however they are being negatively affected by the exchanges occurring in that market. This negative effect will cause a shift in the supply graph because the market is incurring an increased social marginal cost. The social marginal cost consists of the producer marginal cost plus the external marginal cost. In this case the external marginal cost is the negative effects that microplastics cause in the environment. The new social marginal cost graph now intersects the demand graph at a point of higher price and lower supply. Because there is no external benefit in the market for plastics, the demand graph is also the social marginal benefit. The shift of the supply graph, due to the negative marginal cost, also means there will be an area of negative total surplus in the graph (also know as deadweight loss when associated with market equilibrium). This negative total surplus means that the total surplus was not maximized, and thus the market for plastics is a failure. I hope this helps your understanding of market failure!\n\nBest, \nYour Friend                                                                                                             Word Count: 457\n",

      "essay": "Dear Ash,\nI missed sitting next to you in lecture last week! Anyways, I hope all is well. I am reaching out to\nhelp you catch up and learn what you missed. Dr. Dudley began teaching market failures.\nA market failure is basically when absent any intervention (even government intervention), the\nmarket fails to reach the efficient outcome (the market doesn’t maximize total surplus) even in\nequilibrium. There are four market failures we learned: Externalities, Common Resources, Public\nGoods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. We can measure market failures by identifying the total\nsurplus at the market equilibrium, then identifying the efficient outcome, and thus measuring the\ndeadweight loss between the two (in other words, measuring the gap between the two).\nIn this email, I will be focusing on externalities, which are just one form of market failure.\nExternalities can be classified as positive or negative. A positive externality is a benefit an\nindividual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation. An example of this would\nbe vaccines because as more people in a community get immunized, the prevalence and\nlikelihood of unvaccinated individuals contracting the disease decreases significantly. By\ndefinition, a negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on\nothers (i.e. a third party pays a price). An example of this would be emissions from a local\nfactory/warehouse as it would affect the air local residents breathe, thus causing health issues. I\nwill be using the article linked below to help teach what negative externalities are.\nIn this article, power lines created a large wildfire in Smokehouse Creek, Texas. Xcel Energy, a\nMinnesota-based regulated electric utility and natural-gas delivery company, said its equipment\nmay have been involved in sparking the Smokehouse Creek fire. This is representative of a\nnegative externality as the company, Xcel Energy, is imposing an uncompensated cost on the\nSmokehouse Creek residents and community. There are many uncompensated costs that resulted\nfrom this instance such as pollution and the burning down of local houses and businesses,\naffecting the town tremendously. The aftermath of this fire, pollution, caused many adverse\nhealth effects to the townspeople, increasing their need for medical assistance, thus leading to the\nburden of additional medical costs. Also, the community, also a third-party in this instance, had\nto pay the cost of losing their houses and other infrastructure as a result of this fire. Thus, the\ncommunity is now paying the burden of repairing their health and infrastructure due to an\naccident caused by Xcel Energy.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/xcel-energy-review-shows-texas-wildfires-m\nay-have-started-at-its-facilities-18784c69?mod=climate-environment_news_article_pos4\nBest,\nTavleen Rahal\nWord Count: 415",

      "essay": "A market fails when it does not reach an efficient outcome, the market does not maximize\ntotal surplus, even in equilibrium. Efficiency is the maximum total surplus or net gain from the\nmarket. Another way to look at market efficiency is with marginal analysis. Marginal Analysis\nshows that net gain is maximized where marginal benefit intersects marginal cost. We measure a\nmarket failure by identifying the total surplus of the market at equilibrium and comparing it to\nthe efficient outcome of the market. The difference between the total surplus and the efficient\noutcome is deadweight loss. A market is guided toward efficiency through government\nintervention or other outside influence.\nOne type of market failure is an externality. Externalities can be negative or positive. A\nnegative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or other party imposes on\nothers. Negative externalities, also known as external costs, are things like overgrown front\nyards or pollution. Externalities cause market failure because, negative externalities, add to the\nsocial marginal cost. Social marginal cost is equal to the producer marginal cost plus the\nexternal marginal cost, negative externality. The result of this new social marginal cost is a new\nline shifted up from supply. The market is efficient where the social marginal cost is equal to\ndemand, the consumer's marginal benefit. However, the market on its own will operate at\nequilibrium, where demand intersects supply. The market does not reach an efficient outcome\nand thus, externalities cause market failures.\nMarkets can still reach efficiency in the presence of externalities. The Coase Theorem\nstates that in the presence of externalities, an economy can reach efficiency as long as the\ntransaction costs of reaching a deal are sufficiently low. In reality, this is rarely that simple. But\nwhen this happens, individuals take externalities into account and internalize the externality. If\nindividuals do not internalize the externalities, government intervention can push a market\ntowards efficiency. Recently, this has been seen with the Environmental Protection\nAgency’s(EPA) decision to tighten limits on fine industrial particles, a form of air pollution. The\nEPA is attempting to push the market for energy towards efficiency using an environmental\nstandard, a rule that protects the environment by specifying actions by producers and consumers.\nThe EPA attempts to quantify this negative externality by saying, “The new rule would prevent\nan estimated 4,500 premature deaths every year, as well as 290,000 lost workdays because of\nillness.” I will attach the article in case you would like to learn more.\nWhile the EPA chose to push the market using an environmental standard, the\ngovernment can affect markets in several different ways. Looking at pollution, emission taxes\nbased on the quantity of pollution produced or tradable emission permits would hurt producers of\npollution. Each way to reach market efficiency has its benefits and drawbacks. The drawback of\ntaxing emissions is that it is expensive for the government to track.\nLet me know if you have any more questions.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=1\nWords 494",

I understand that the concept of market failure has been\nchallenging for you to understand, so I am writing this email to you today in hopes of helping\nyou to understand the concept better.\nIn general, market failure is when, without government intervention, the market fails to\nreach its most efficient outcome, even in equilibrium. Reasons for market failure include positive\nand negative externalities, public goods, artificially scarce goods, and common resources.\nTo clearly illustrate the concept of market failure, I found an article from the New Y ork\nTimes, which is located in the Works Cited section at the end of this email, that illustrates a\nreal-world example of a market failure. The article discusses the idea that the increase in\npollution across the United States has caused many citizens to migrate to the South. This creates\na negative externality, as the migrants are severely hurt by the pollution, but had no part in\ncausing the pollution. A negative externality is an unintentional cost that goes unrealized by\nsociety and these cause the market to fail because individuals within the market do not realize\nthese extra costs and therefore overproduce with an additional cost unnoticed. If your neighbor’s\nyard is untended and unappealing to look at, the price of your house decreases because the\ngeneral look of the neighborhood is degraded. The neighbor’s yard is unintentionally causing an\nextra cost to others, including you.\nIn the article, pollution is a negative externality because it causes detrimental effects to\nthe migrants’ health, but the pollution-causers don’t realize this cost, leading to its social\nmarginal cost becoming unrealized. Social marginal cost is the producer's marginal cost, which\ncan also be visualized as the supply curve, plus the external marginal cost in the market, which is\nthe pollution in this case. If the pollution’s cost was realized by society, the supply for items\ncausing pollution would have a leftward shift because society would want this detrimental cost to\ndecrease. The quantity and price of goods causing pollution would decrease to reach the most\nefficient outcome in the market. The demand curve will not shift left, however, because society\ndoesn’t realize this additional cost yet, so they have no reason to attempt to fix this cost. Because\nof this, the current market quantity will remain less than the efficient quantity, meaning the\nmarket has failed to reach its most efficient outcome. A potential solution is taking initiative and\neducating society to see the harm that pollution brings to everyone.\nI hope you find this email helpful in understanding the concept of market failure better.\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend in ECON 101\nWord Count: 457\nWorks Cited\nMahoney, Adam. “The Most Overlooked Reason Black Americans Are Moving South.” The\nNew Y ork Times, February 2, 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/opinion/great-migration-black-americans-environment.ht\nml",

      "essay": "To: John@umich.edu\nFrom: anuragkr@umich.edu\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure\nHello John,\nI hope all is well with you. Regarding your questions about market failure, I found an article that\nmight help you understand market failure. As a fellow Econ 101 student, this article may prove\nuseful to you.\nMarket failure is when the free market is deemed inefficient as it cannot allocate products as\nefficiently as possible. This market failures can be caused by externalities (outside effects),\npublic goods (goods accessible to all for free), artificially scarce goods (goods made scarce by\nproducers), or common resources (resources available to all) which lead to this inefficient state.\nThe article explores the market failure of how concrete production creates a detrimental impact\nto the environment. Throughout the article, efforts from notable figures such as Bill Gates are\ndiscussed. According to the article, concrete causes 7% of the world's carbon emissions.\nAlthough concrete is very widely used, this shows that concrete production introduces a market\nfailure.\nThe reason this is a market failure is due to the negative externality that is caused from the\nproduction of concrete. The negative externality in this case is the pollution into the\nenvironment. Since producers do not account for the costs on the environment from the carbon\nemissions, these costs are shifted to the rest of society as a whole. This is an inefficient outcome,\nas the market price of concrete is not accounting for this added cost on society due to the\nenvironmental issues.\nWhen looking at market graphs, the market failure will result in a leftward shift in the market\nequilibrium. This shows that the social efficiency is actually lower than the actual predicted\nefficiency. As a result, price decreases and quantity supplied undergoes a leftward shift. This\nportrays the market inefficiency.\nCompanies are shifting to address the market failure by incorporating greener alternatives to\nconcrete. These alternatives consist of other materials or less diminishing concrete. These\nalternatives will produce less carbon emissions, reducing negative externality and helping the\nmarket become closer to being fully efficient, reaching that theoretical market equilibrium.\nThis article shows a real world example of market failure. It also shows how externalities can be\ndealt with to lead to more efficient outcomes in the market.\nI hope this analysis helped your understanding of market failure.

      "essay": "Dear Friend of Econ 101,\nI am emailing to help you in the task of learning about different market failures. Before\nwe jump into the complexities of artificially scarce goods it is important to understand the basis\nof market failure. Market failure is defined as the asymmetrical distribution of goods and\nservices. As a result, the market operates at inefficient levels causing disproportionate\ndeadweight loss. If you aren’t familiar, deadweight loss is the cost to society created by the\ninefficiencies of the market.\nMarket failure can be defined in many ways, and there are various causes. Commonly\nknown as externalities. There are two types of externalities; positive and negative. A positive\nexternality is a scenario in which non participating members of the market benefit from. For\nexample, vaccines are a positive externality because not only do they benefit and protect the\npeople who receive them, but they also benefit and protect the people who have not received\nthem. On the contrary, negative externalities are the negative impacts felt by members of society\nwho do not participate in said market. An example of this would be pollution, while oil\ncompanies benefit from the sale and use of oil based products, they negatively impact the\nenvironment. In turn the negative impact on the environment can harm the living conditions of\nsociety with factors, namely, poor air quality.\nNow that you have an understanding of what externalities are, it is time to explore how\ndifferent types of goods and services can cause market failure. Using the attached article as a\nreference, I will explain why and how failure occurs in the insulin market. Insulin is a good that\nwill always be in demand no matter the price, because the consumer’s life depends on it. As you\nmay have heard in the news, Insulin prices have been extremely high recently and unsustainable\nfor the consumers. This is a result of pharmaceutical companies controlling the distribution of\nthis good and driving the prices up (Armour). When a single entity controls the production and\nthe distribution of a certain good, it is classified as an artificially scarce good. The reason this\ncauses a failure in the market is because the consumer benefit is reduced and replaced with\noverwhelming producer benefit. This results in an unreasonably high deadweight loss number.\nAs hopeless as market failure seems, there is a way to correct the inefficiencies. With the use of\ncorrect government intervention, a market can return to the efficient outcome. “President Biden\n– saying \"we finally beat big pharma\" – called for capping insulin costs to $35 for\nall.”(Biden's 2024 State of the Union: Updates and Analysis). In this case, a price ceiling can\nhelp correct the market inefficiencies and move the market for insulin back to the efficient\noutcome. In turn, the consumers will once again experience benefits from the market without the\nfinancial burden of high insulin prices. I hope this explanation helps you understand market\nfailure as a whole, and specifically artificially scarce goods.

      "essay": "Hey friend! Hope your family is well. I found an example of market failure to hopefully help you understand the concept. It might be important to first get a real grasp on what a market failure is, in a general sense. We know from class so far that in a perfectly competitive market, the forces of supply and demand are expected to reach equilibrium, where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, and resources are allocated efficiently. Market failure occurs when the distribution of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, leading to a misallocation of resources. \nThere are a couple types of market failures, the specific one that I found an example of in the news is what's called a “public good”. Public goods are non-rivalrous, meaning that one person can use one unit of that thing, or simply put, it benefits multiple people at once. Like national security or cable television. Public goods are also non-excludable, which means you can’t prevent those who didn't pay for an item from using it. Like a tax evader using a sidewalk paid for by taxes. Here is a link to the New York Times article I found about putting a market price on nature. CLICK HERE! The idea is that people can invest money into plots of land across America in order to stimulate a positive push towards ecosystem rejuvenation. With one current project that includes 1.6 million acres owned by a North American tribal entity, that weather investors can now place capital in. \nTo tie back into the market failure context, let's look at the definition of a public good using this article. A public good is non-rivalrous. Especially in the context of projects such as a 1.6 million acre owned by a Native American tribe, there are thousands of people who can use and benefit from this unit of land all at once. A public good is non-excludable. Pieces of land, whether it's tribal land, owned by a cattle farmer or a national park, are almost guaranteed to be used by people who are not paying for the good. Both of these criteria lead to a public good instigated market failure. This market failure often leads to the free-rider problem where people may benefit from the good without contributing to its provision. As a result, private markets may under-provide public goods because there is little incentive for private firms to produce them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Cited\nDePillis, Lydia. “Nature Has Value.

      "essay": "Hi friend, \nI just want to say I’m sorry to hear about your family emergency and I hope you’re doing well. I would love to help explain to you the topic of market failure as it is a crucial topic in our economics class.\nTo start off, market failure is when there is an inefficient allocation of resources in a free market because individuals act in rational self-interest which produces a less-than-optimal outcome, in other words the market doesn’t maximize its total surplus. There are many types of imbalances that can affect the equilibrium of markets that cause them to fail leading to the market either under or over producing. An example of one of these imbalances is the presence of externalities. Externalities occur when the consumption of a good benefits or hurts a third party that is uninvolved in the initial transaction. If it is a positive externality, there is a benefit that an individual gives to others without receiving compensation which causes an external benefit and the market to underproduce. To simplify even more you can think of an example like vaccines because they don’t just benefit the person receiving it, but that person is now contributing to the societal benefit of herd immunity which puts people less at risk. On the other hand, there are also negative externalities in which there is an uncompensated cost that an individual imposes on others. An example of this external cost is pollution. I know this concept may be confusing, so I found an article that shows a specific real-world example of a negative externality.\nHere is the recent article published in the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/19/soot-pollution-rule-biden-epa/\nThis article discusses how the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is attempting to tighten regulations on soot pollution which is an air pollutant that is associated with many major health problems. The concept of externalities is at work here because this soot pollution is the result of large factories’ emissions. The EPA is advocating that the limiting of these soot emissions will provide economic and health benefits by preventing hospitalizations and lost workdays to those who are exposed to this unhealthy air. This unhealthy air is currently costing thousands of people, mainly in marginalized communities, major health implications because these soot particles are penetrating deep into their lungs and entering the bloodstream causing severe cases of asthma and heart disease. \nWhen companies and consumers make decisions about production and consumption, they don’t consider the full societal/external cost of their actions, such as the health care expenses that occur due to pollution-related issues. The market clearly fails to account for these external costs, which leads to the market overproducing the products that come from pollution-generating activities. In this article, the EPA is trying to impose stricter limits on pollution emissions to correct this market failure and allocate resources efficiently and protect society and the environment. \n\tPlease reach out if you need any further clarifications and I hope to see you soon!\nBest, \n(word count: 494)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   References\nJoselow, Maxine. “New EPA Rule Could Save 4,200 Lives a Year.

I am more than happy to show you my knowledge regarding market failures and relating it to what we have covered in class while you have been gone.\n\tMarket failures can be relatively tricky as they have been introduced and taught to us with their connection to externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce resources. We must develop the skills to distinguish them amongst these categories, accurately classify them, and find a means for intervention for them. \nThe one thing they all have in common is that market failures occur when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome, or in other words, does not maximize its total surplus or society’s total net gain despite being in equilibrium. With market failures also come misallocation of goods and services as well as major losses in society. In order to avoid market failures, we must find where the Marginal Benefit intersects with the Marginal Cost since we want our consumer gaining more than they lose through paying. We must also take measures to prevent failures through interventions such as Pigouvian taxes to regulate/ discourage activity, environmental standards like rules, production quotas, etc.\n\tTo make more sense of this, I have found an article through The Wall Street Journal called Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance. Is Health Insurance Next? This article carefully articulates a market failure and helped me further put the concept into perspective after seeing a real-life scenario. \nThe article is about the continuing crisis society faces with climate change and extreme weather and how that is affecting individuals with property insurance availability and rates and health insurances. The market failure present in this situation is an externality because this market failed in being efficient and more specifically, the cost or benefit here financially affected third parties who were not even directly involved. Furthermore, this scenario exhibits a negative externality as our course content references pollution as negative externalities and it is evident how climate change and pollution are the cause of rising rates. With this negative externality, the market equilibrium ultimately results in too many units of the good compared to the standard at the efficient level. This makes sense because these factors are imposing financially and medically in many communities in the United States and other countries. Moreover, it appears this negative externality results in being more costly than the actual benefit for the consumers and because of this, there is a need for it to be addressed with efficiency methods such as environmental standards. \n\tAll in all, I appreciate you reaching out to me and I hope that this email finds you well and you can better understand market failures.

      "essay": "Dr. Mitchell Dudley\nEconomics 101\nMarch 26, 2024\nDear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well. Regarding your previous email, I would love to help\nexplain market failure to the best of my ability. Market Failure, as defined in lecture, occurs\nwhen the market does not reach the efficient outcome of maximizing total surplus (Dudley,\nExternalities). This failure occurs because the market itself is not accounting for all of the costs\nand benefits in a decision that it makes. In order to further understand the impacts of Market\nFailure, it will be useful to understand the relationship between externalities, both positive and\nnegative, on the Market. Market equilibrium, as you likely remember, is when the quantities\nsupplied and demanded are equal. Both types of externalities cause the market to fail to be\nefficient. Externalities are settings where people make decisions and consequences of those\ndecisions end up resting upon other people who have no connection to that decision (Dudley,\nExternalities). Positive Externalities result in too few units of the good compared to the efficient\nlevel and Negative Externalities result and too many units of the good compared to the efficient\nlevel. By failing to account for an externality, the market equilibrium does not generate as much\nTotal Surplus as possible.\nIt may be helpful to provide a real-world example to understand the effects of an\nExternality and how it relates to a Market Failure.The attached article describes the effects of\nmicroplastics on human health. Scientists are linking microplastics to diseases that attack the\ncardiovascular, reproductive, neurological, and digestive systems. Microplastics are the waste\nrunoff produced as a result of plastic production. “The researchers found that microplastics had\nbecome embedded in the fatty plaque that clings to the walls of blood vessels, and that patients\nwith plastic-infused plaque were 4.5 times as likely to experience a heart attack, stroke or death\ncompared with those whose plaque was free of microplastics (Jacobs)”. Curation of plastic is\narguably one of the greatest advances made by humanity, however the inability to truly recycle\nand break down these products are causing great strife on human health. This is an example of a\nnegative externality as microplastics, produced by the market, were an unaccounted result of\nproduction which is poisoning unrelated humans and animals. By failing to account for the\nmicroplastic waste, too many units of the goods are produced compared to the efficient level\nwhich would account for the runoff. Therefore, the market fails to reach efficiency.\nAdditional contributors to market failure include public goods, common resources, and\nartificially scarce resources. Public goods cause market failure because they have no rivals in\nconsumption and are non-excludable. The market is unable to allocate public goods efficiently,\nleading to market failure. Common resources have rivals in consumption but are non-excludable,\nleading to overuse of resources, inhibiting market efficiency. Artificially scarce resources are\nexcludable but have no rival in consumption which causes market equilibrium to be a higher\nprice and lower quantity than the efficient outcome, which is a market failure.\nBest Wishes,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 496\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York\nTimes, The New York Times, 9 Mar . 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searc\nhResultPosition=2.\nDudley, Mitchell. \"Externalities.\" 23 Mar . 2024, Economics 101, Department of\nEconomics, University of Michigan.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nThank you for emailing me, I will gladly help you understand market failures better. Market\nfailures occur when the use/distribution of goods or services is inefficient. We learned that\nefficiency is where it maximizes total surplus which is society’s total net gain (lecture). Market\nfailures are associated with negative externalities too. These are the different costs that people or\ncompanies have that affect others. To explain the whole concept of market failure better, I will\ntell you about this article I found in the New Y ork Times that provides a great example of a\nmarket failure and a negative externality.\nIn the article “We’re All Climate Economists Now” by Lydia Depillis, they talk about the\nnegative externality of pollution. Pollution is considered a negative externality because of the\nspillover costs that impact others, this contributes to global warming and climate change which\naffects the world. In the article, they discuss various origin markets for pollution such as wildfire\nsmoke, which affects various economic aspects, including household finances. This suggests that\nindustries or activities generating pollution, such as wildfires or industrial emissions, could be\nconsidered as the origin markets for pollution. The article also mentions carbon emissions and\ntheir impact on climate change, highlighting the economic costs associated with higher\ntemperatures, such as reduced factory productivity. The industries or sectors responsible for\ncarbon emissions, including transportation, energy production, and manufacturing, could be\nconsidered as the origin markets for carbon emissions and their associated pollution. Another\norigin market is the failure of regulatory policies that should be preventing pollution from\noccurring but fail to do this. All of these impact people, and the economy.\nIn the article, they discuss how climate change is becoming a focus for many professionals in\neconomics since this is a relevant issue in today’s world. Economists know that climate change\nwill impact countries around the world's gross domestic product (DePillis). The goal that\neconomists are trying to achieve is to find ways that societies can face the effects that come with\nclimate change (DePillis). They are working towards minimizing the negative impact that the\nnegative externality of pollution creates. In the article, they mention that an idea that is starting to\nbe introduced is having incentives for clean energy production. There is an increase in demand\nfor climate economists, as this negative externality is affecting the world and people’s lives every\nday. This market failure is just an example of how much impact they can truly pose on society as\na whole, and pollution is a very common one that must be addressed.

      "essay": "1\nDear Friend,\nI am sorry to hear of your family emergency and I am happy to help you understand\nconcepts from class that you missed. The main term which I will thoroughly explain is called\nmarket failure. Market failure can be most simply defined as “an inefficient distribution of goods\nand services in the free market” (Econ Library). Y ou are familiar with the traditional supply and\ndemand curve in which equilibrium is achieved when the quantity supplied equals the quantity\ndemanded. Market failure occurs when this basic concept is subverted in some way. There are\nvarious factors which may lead to market failure including externalities, artificially scarce goods,\ncommon resources, and public goods.\nI will be using the externalities example to explain market failure as I feel it is the most\nclear in providing you with an understanding of the concept. Externalities occur when an\nuninvolved third party is affected by a transaction between producer and consumer. Externalities\ncan be either positive or negative. One situation in which a negative externality occurs is\npollution as a result of manufacturing. Shein is a company which makes clothing items based on\nfashion trends. The brand sells what is referred to as “ultra fast fashion” where items are made\nquickly and also thrown out quickly (Symons). This has created significant environmental\nproblems, notably water pollution, microplastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions\n(Symons). The production, transportation, and disposal of the merchandise are all ecologically\nproblematic. The pollution affects the environment, which is a third party which exists outside of\nconsumers and producers of Shein goods, hence the name externality as an outside entity is\ninvolved.\nRefer to the basic supply and demand curve to understand market failure via externalities.\nPollution is a social marginal cost which can be shown on a graph. The social marginal cost\n2\ncurve is to the left of the supply curve and runs parallel to it (assuming there is constant marginal\ncost. This means that the social marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve at a point that is\nreferred to as the efficient quantity, which is different from the market equilibrium quantity.\nBecause of this negative side effect of the transaction of a good or service, the market\nequilibrium price and quantity are no longer efficient, thus there is a market failure.\nDespite the negative connotation of the word failure, there are positive examples as well.\nA positive externality occurs when a third party is benefitted by a transaction. For example, an\nunvaccinated person is positively affected when someone in their community receives a vaccine\nas they are now less likely to contract the disease. Positive externalities create a social marginal\nbenefit curve which runs parallel and to the right of the demand curve if constant.\nThere are other examples which I have not explained, though I hope you have an idea of\na market failure.\nSincerely,\nConnor\n3\nWorks Cited\n“Market Failures.” Econlib, 13 Aug. 2021,\nwww.econlib.org/library/Topics/HighSchool/MarketFailures.html.\n“Shein Ads Could Soon Be Banned in France under New Fast Fashion Bill.” Euronews,\nwww.euronews.com/green/2024/03/15/an-ecological-disaster-french-bill-proposes-crackd\nown-on-throwaway-culture-of-ultra-fast-f.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nThe economic term “market failure” can be confusing, and using a real-life example can\nhelp you understand the principle more accurately. In general, market failure occurs when\npursing self-interest leads to negative consequences for society. During market failure, the\nmarket does not maximize the total surplus and does not fully reach the efficient outcome. This\ncan occur even at market equilibrium if the maximum total surplus is not reached. The total net\ngain is maximized on a supply and demand chart where the social marginal costs intersect the\nsocial marginal benefits. Some examples of market failure include water and air pollution,\noverfishing, and overgrazing. The main reasons why markets do not reach efficiency are positive\nand negative externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nThese causes of market failure are seen in many everyday situations. For example, John\nKeilman wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal that explains how American manufacturers\nin various industries have been working to improve the quality of their products after recalls and\naccidents in the automotive and aviation industries due to poor production practices (Keilman).\nThe article specifically mentions companies like Ford, Stellantis, and Boeing which are all\ncompanies that have experienced quality control issues recently. Since these companies have\nfaced criticism and financial backlash due to product malfunctions, they are now putting in extra\neffort to improve the quality and construction of their products. Other, unrelated markets have\nalso started to improve production quality as a result. In this case, the identified market failure is\nthat consumers in unrelated markets are now receiving better quality products and services\nbecause of the failures in quality production in other markets. These customers did not have to\nface the challenges that come from poor quality control. Instead, they are only reaping the\nbenefits from companies across many markets working to improve production and quality. This\nis classified as a positive externality, also known as an external benefit, because consumers in\nunrelated markets, like pharmaceuticals and food, have benefited from quality issues in the\naviation and automotive industries. A positive externality is defined as a benefit that an\nindividual or company gives to others without receiving anything in return. Additionally, in a\npositive externality, the market equilibrium results in too few units of a good compared to the\nmost efficient amount. In this case, companies should ensure their quality standards meet the\nneeds of their consumers. Still, too much of a focus on quality control may lead to shortages in\nproduction or inefficiently high-quality products.\nBest Regards,\nY our Friend\n(Word Count = 420)\nWorks Cited\nKeilman, John. “American Manufacturers Seek Perfection as Quality Issues Mount.” WSJ,\nwww.wsj.com/business/american-manufacturers-seek-perfection-as-quality-issues-mount\n-6883d6b8?mod=WTRN_pos2&cx_testId=3&cx_testV ariant=cx_164&cx_artPos=1.\nAccessed 18 Mar. 2024.",

      "essay": "‭ Dear Friend,‬\n‭ Market failure occurs when the market is unable to reach efficiency or maximum output‬\n‭ of total surplus, even at equilibrium. Some ways that we can measure how much the market fails‬\n‭ is by finding the difference between the total surplus of the market at equilibrium and the total‬\n‭ surplus of the market when it is efficient. The market is efficient when the social marginal‬\n‭ benefit curve and the social marginal cost curves intersect.‬\n‭ The most common way to find the total surplus of the market is to see what parties make‬\n‭ up society. Some things that can cause market failure are Externalities (both positive and‬\n‭ negative), Common Resources, Public Goods, etc.‬\n‭ Externalities are costs or benefits that were unaccounted for, caused by the market. These‬\n‭ externalities are split into two categories based on their effect. If it causes a cost in the market, it‬\n‭ is a negative externality. If it causes a benefit, then it is a positive externality.‬\n‭ I recently read an article where there are lawsuits filed against the E.P.A for lowering the‬\n‭ annual limit for fine particulate matter in the air caused by pollution. “This regulation would help‬\n‭ prevent people from inhaling fatal or unhealthy amounts of fine particles. And would prevent an‬\n‭ estimated 4,500 premature deaths every year, as well as 290,000 lost workdays because of this‬\n‭ illness” (Friedman). In this article, the negative externality is the pollution. This is a negative‬\n‭ externality because the pollution caused by companies is affecting workers and other people who‬\n‭ aren’t accounted for in the market of whatever the companies are producing.‬\n‭ To measure this failure in the market, you want to draw out the social marginal benefit‬\n‭ and social marginal cost curves. The social marginal benefit curve is based on the demand curve,‬\n‭ and since there are no external benefits from this market, the demand curve would be the social‬\n‭ marginal benefit curve.

      "essay": "Econ 101 Writing Assignment 3 First Draft\nDear Friend,\nHow are you? I heard you are struggling to understand market failures, so here is a short\nexplanation. A market failure is a situation in which the free market does not reach the most\nefficient outcome, which is the one that maximizes total surplus (Dudley, 2024). Despite what we\nhave learned in previous chapters, the market equilibrium point where supply and demand\nintersect is not always the most efficient outcome because there are certain cases and goods that\ncan defy how we usually expect markets to behave. Some categories of market failure include\nexternalities, public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods.\nY ou may actually have read about an example of one of these in the news lately, when the\nNew Y ork Times reported that Ruth Gottesman made a generous donation to the Albert Einstein\nCollege of Medicine that will allow all students to attend the school tuition-free (Goldstein,\n2024). This is good news, since the donation allows many medical students to graduate without\ncrushing debt and financial burden, but it is considered a market failure because tuition at this\ncollege is now considered a “common resource.” This is a specific classification of a good that\nwe learned in lecture. We classify goods as a combination of excludable or nonexcludable, and\nrival or nonrival. An excludable good is one that producers can prevent others from consuming\nwithout payment, and a nonexcludable good is one that producers cannot prevent others from\nconsuming, like clean air. A rival good is one that is impossible for more than one person to\nconsume one unit of at the same time, like a sandwich or movie ticket. A nonrival good is one\nthat multiple people can consume one unit of at the same time, like an episode of a television\nshow or public safety. A common resource is the term given to a good that is both nonexcludable\nand rival in consumption. Since any student at Albert Einstein can consume tuition without\nproviding any payment, tuition is a nonexcludable good, and because only one student can\nconsume one year of tuition at a time, it is rival in consumption. Common resources cause\nmarket failure because those who act in self-interest will overconsume a good that is readily\navailable to them without payment, but because this good is finite and rival in consumption it\nwill eventually become depleted or destroyed, to the detriment of society. However, Einstein\nCollege regulates who has access to their resources by only admitting the number of students that\ntheir school has capacity for. The recent news might mean more students apply in hopes that they\ncan take advantage of this common resource, but ultimately tuition is regulated and will one day\nbe depleted when enough students attend the college and use up the donation. Other common\nresources such as clean water are regulated by the government by taxing its usage or issuing\nlicenses to use the resource.\nSincerely,\nY our friend\nWord count: 482\nReferences\nDudley, M.

      "essay": "To: My Friend\nSubject: Market Failure\nHey, I just saw your email about needing help with understanding the concept of market\nfailure. Market failure is when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome even in equilibrium,\nand without any interaction including the government. For a market to reach an efficient\noutcome, it must maximize total surplus. Some of the different ways that a market failure may\noccur is through positive or negative externalities, common resources, public goods, or\nartificially scarce goods.\nI actually just recently read a really good article about a common resource that I can use\nto try to explain to you about how they are a market failure. Here’s the link:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/medical-school-student-loan-debt-7c4feeb2?mod=Searc\nhresults_pos2&page=1. The article talks about how medical schools are starting to give\nscholarships to a lot of need-based students.\nThis would be classified as a market failure because free education is classified as a\ncommon resource because it is non-excludable, but a rival in consumption. If a good is\nexcludable, that means that the supplier of that good can exclude people who don’t pay from\nconsuming that good. Rivaling in consumption means that goods can not be consumed by more\nthan one person at a time. Free education is a non-excludable resource because schools can not\nexclude those who do not pay, but it is a rival in consumption because they can only accept a\ncertain number of students. Therefore when a student is admitted they are taking away a spot that\ncould have gone to another student.\nAlthough it may not seem like it, free education is classified as a market failure because\ndue to the education being free there is no private cost to the individual, but there is a social cost\nto taking up a spot that could have gone to somebody else. Therefore, the market may overuse\nthe free education system. For example, people who may not have had any interest in going to\nmedical school may take the spots of those who are genuinely passionate about medicine because\nthey see the opportunity to get a free education for a prestigious job that will make them money.\nThis makes it harder for others to get that spot because more people are applying. This makes the\nefficient quantity for consumption lower than the actual market quantity which creates\ninefficiency in the market.\nI hope this helped you understand a little bit more about market failures! If you have any\nmore questions I’ll try to help you the best I can.\n- Y our friend\n- Word Count: 430\nCitations\nDudley, M. Lecture “Externalities”. 2024.

      "essay": "‭ Hello friend,‬\n‭ I hope you're doing well! I’m glad you reached out, as I am happy to help! Market failures are‬\n‭ definitely a tricky concept to grasp, but I think I've found a recent article that might help explain‬\n‭ it a bit.‬\n‭ A market failure essentially occurs when the allocation of goods and services in a free market is‬\n‭ not efficient. This can happen due to various reasons and includes the concepts of externalities,‬\n‭ common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. However, I will be focusing on‬\n‭ externalities because that is the market failure in the article I’ve found to help explain this‬\n‭ concept. Externalities are basically the unintended side effects of economic activities that affect‬\n‭ third parties, either positively or negatively, without compensation. The name of the article is‬\n‭ \"The Planet Needs Solar Power. Can We Build It without Harming Nature?\" from The New York‬\n‭ Times, and I think it perfectly illustrates the concept of a market failure through a negative‬\n‭ externality.‬\n‭ The article highlights the constant battle between renewable energy development, particularly‬\n‭ solar farms, and wildlife habitat conservation. While the push for renewable energy is necessary‬\n‭ to combat climate change, the development of solar farms in agricultural and wild areas poses a‬\n‭ threat to biodiversity by encroaching upon natural habitats.‬\n‭ This is where the market failure comes into play. The article discusses how solar farm developers‬\n‭ are prioritizing the establishment of solar farms without sufficiently considering the impact on‬\n‭ wildlife and ecosystems. This results in a negative externality for the wildlife, as they are losing‬\n‭ habitat space, which is an uncompensated cost on society.‬\n‭ As explained in the article, the construction of solar farms leads to habitat loss and‬\n‭ fragmentation, endangering species like pronghorn, mule deer, and elk. Despite potential‬\n‭ solutions such as wildlife corridors and permeable fencing to mitigate these impacts, developers‬\n‭ often overlook these measures due to regulatory hurdles, lack of research, and cost concerns.‬\n‭ This creates an uncompensated external cost, in this case on the wildlife, that causes an‬\n‭ inefficient allocation of resources and a loss of total surplus because of the inability to account‬\n‭ for this externality.‬\n‭ The land used for solar farms represents a common resource, a resource available for multiple‬\n‭ uses but subject to degradation or depletion if not managed sustainably. The failure to properly‬\n‭ address the externalities associated with solar farm development leads to the degradation of this‬\n‭ common resource, negatively affecting both wildlife and the environment.‬\n‭ So, to sum it up, the article highlights how the expansion of solar farms without adequate‬\n‭ consideration for wildlife conservation exemplifies market failure due to negative externalities.‬\n‭ I hope this helps your understanding of the concept of market failure for you!

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope your family is well. In this letter, I will explain what a market failure is and\nprovide an example for you.\nFirstly, a market failure occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome\n(maximizing total surplus) without any intervention, even in equilibrium. To measure market\nfailure, you would find the difference between the market total surplus at equilibrium and the\nefficient outcome. To find the efficient outcome, you would find the point where social marginal\ncost (producer marginal cost plus external marginal cost) and social marginal benefit (consumer\nmarginal benefit plus external marginal benefit) intersect. Some reasons for market failure are\nexternalities, common resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods (these factors are what\ngenerates external costs). In this letter, I will talk about an article with an example of a negative\nexternality causing market failure.\nAttached to the letter is an article from The New York Times that describes how\nsubsidence (sinking land) is endangering Americans living along the coast, who are already at\nrisk due to sea-level rise. The article states that “human activities, like extracting groundwater or\noil and gas are a key factor in subsidence in many places” (Rojanasakul). Recall that externalities\nare uncompensated costs or benefits that individuals or firms put onto third parties unrelated to\nthe market. Since firms in the groundwater and oil/gas industry play a major role in subsidence,\nand subsidence puts coastal Americans at risk for sea-level rise, we can say that subsidence is a\nnegative externality that arises from the groundwater and oil/gas industry. The market is\ncurrently overproducing this negative externality, creating costs from Americans who may lose\ntheir homes or businesses. Therefore, the equilibrium total surplus in the groundwater and oil/gas\nmarket includes an external cost that reduces total surplus and increases deadweight loss. This is\nin comparison to the efficient outcome, which would have no deadweight loss. In this situation,\nthe social marginal cost is greater than the producer marginal cost and the social marginal benefit\nis the same as the consumer marginal benefit. When the social marginal cost and social marginal\nbenefit intersect, the efficient price will end up being greater than the market price, and the\nefficient quantity will be less than the market quantity.\nNote that the efficient quantity of the groundwater and oil/gas market would likely not be\n0, even though it has a negative externality that harms society. The benefits that come from\nnegative externalities can often override the negative effects, so the efficient quantity of negative\nexternalities is not often 0.\nI hope this letter has helped you understand market failure in economics.\nWarm regards,\nY our Friend\nWord count: 436\nWork Cited\nRojanasakul, Mira. “New Data Details the Risk of Sea-Level Rise for U.S. Coastal Cities.” The\nNew York Times, 6 March 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/sea-level-rise-east-coast-sinking-land-flood\ning.html.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nTo: A friend in need\nFrom: Your classmate\n\nFriend,\n\tI’m writing in response to your concern about not fully understanding the concept of market failure in our Econ101 class.  Broadly defined, market failure is when the market fails to be efficient without any form of government or third-party intervention. One common form of market failure is called an externality, which is when a certain market affects a third party in either a positive or negative manner. Since the market fails to account for the externality, it does not generate as much total surplus as possible, causing the market to be inefficient. \n\tIn order to clearly illustrate the concept of market failure, and in particular, externalities, I want to discuss a positive externality that recently occurred in Maine. The New York Times interviewed Kaylie McLaughlin, a woman who lives in Farmingdale, Maine about her decision to make the switch from using oil furnaces to heat pumps to keep her home warm during the harsh Maine winter. She told NYT that every four weeks, she would spend $400 on having oil delivered to her house to keep her oil furnace working. Ms. McLaughlin decided to switch her heating system to heat pumps, which made economic sense as she would no longer need to have oil delivered as heat pumps extract heat from outside air, compress it, and pump it indoors. Ms. McLaughlin expressed her satisfaction with the heat pumps by stating, “I just feel so comfortable”, as not only is she saving money, but the heat is now more evenly spread throughout the house making the house feel “toastier”. A side benefit that Ms. McLaughlin did not consider while making this switch was that oil furnaces emit carbon into the air, while heat pumps are environmentally friendly. Her switch was having a positive impact on the environment, even though that was not her desire while making the switch. If you want to read more about the situation, here is the link to the article: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/climate/heat-pumps-maine-electrification.html?searchResultPosition=5\nThe externality in this situation is that the equilibrium quantity of heat pumps being used as the source of heat in houses is lower than the efficient quantity of heat pumps that should be used in houses. If the market were to take into the account the benefits that having heat pumps installed in houses has on the environment, the quantity of heat pumps would be higher. Since the market is unaware of this third party being affected, it produces an inefficient amount of heat pumps and does not maximize total surplus.\nI hope this article and explanation helps clear some confusion.\nFrom,\nYour Classmate\n",

      "essay": "Dear Bestie,\n\tCall me a genie because I am here to grant your wish of wanting to understand the concept of market failure. I will explain the concept and related factors while citing an article that exemplifies a market failure. Market failure is a situation where an inefficient amount of goods and services are distributed in a free market. The population receives too many costs or too few benefits from participating normally in self-interest. This is caused by externalities and different types of goods. \n\tTwo factors differentiate types of goods. Nonrival goods are when one person uses a good and another person can simultaneously access it. An example is movies. If I watch Aladdin, it doesn’t stop you from watching it as well. An example of rival is clothing. If I wear a sweatshirt you cannot wear the same sweatshirt at that time. We aren’t that close. Excludable goods are when there is a set price at which someone can access that good. A public park is free to enter so it is non-excludable. A concert ticket is excludable because there is a certain price some will pay and others will not. Goods that are either nonrival, non-excludable, or both create market failure. If something is non-excludable, it creates the free-rider problem where some people who benefit from the good underpay. Nonrival resources may become overused and depleted or underpaid for as well. \n\tA positive externality is when there is an unexpected benefit to a third party that is not accounted for. This means the market is operating inefficiently low and should be exchanging more goods and services to receive more benefits. A negative externality is when there is an unexpected cost to a third party that is not accounted for. This means the market is operating inefficiently and should be exchanging fewer goods and services to cut costs. \n\tA great example of a negative externality is the article found at https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-epa-squeeze-on-fossil-fuels-particulate-fire-eu-biden-investment-e817cb20?mod=Searchresults_pos5&page=1. The EPA wishes to reduce fine particulate matter which is a pollutant. The EPA has jurisdiction to approve or block projects involving drilling, fossil fuel combustion, and other pollution-related activities. Pollution is a negative externality of construction. For this reason, the free market was operating inefficiently because too much construction was being permitted in turn creating a large amount of pollution. Now, with the EPA’s restrictions, less construction is being approved. That regulation is adding efficiency to the market because the pollution is being accounted for and cut down. Every person affected by that pollution is the unrelated third party having the cost or benefit applied to them (in this case, a cost).\n\tHopefully, this helped to learn about market failure.

I want to help you in any way and have worked hard to understand the material\nmyself in hopes that you can come to terms with market failures and all that is encompassed in it.\nTo reiterate what we know, a market failure occurs when the market is unable to reach the\nefficient outcome, where total surplus is maximized. To understand this, we must begin with\nunderstanding what it means for the market to reach the “efficient outcome.” This happens when\nboth the producer and consumer find the best possible outcome for themselves, which does not\nnecessarily mean the market has to be at equilibrium but, again, when society’s total surplus is\nmaximized. To “maximize total surplus” occurs where the social marginal benefit intersects\nsocial marginal cost on the supply and demand curve. Easier explained on the graph itself, these\ntwo curves have a few different variations of what they may look like. These are called\nexternalities, both positive and negative. A positive externality benefits others without receiving\ncompensation, also known as an ‘external benefit,’ which will be a shift of the demand curve,\nbecoming the social marginal benefit. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that is\nimposed onto others, also known as an ‘external cost,’ which is a shift of the supply curve and\nbecomes the social marginal cost. Again, the point at which the social marginal benefit and\nsocial marginal cost intersect is the efficient outcome and maximizes total surplus because both\nproducers and consumers are in a best-case scenario. The market fails when it cannot reach these\nstandards of efficiency.\nA common example of a negative externality resulting in a market failure is the issue of\nclimate change today. Climate change is a negative externality because, as author Lydia Depillis\nexplains in her article “We’re All Climate Economists Now,” the United States’ carbon\nemissions are not only affecting the nation’s air quality, but the rest of the world’s, too (Depillis).\nThis can be categorized as a negative externality because the rest of the world has no control\nover how much carbon the United States pollutes the air with, but they do have to suffer the\nconsequences that come from its actions. Clean air is a common resource because it is rival in\nconsumption and nonexcludable; this means consumers do not have to pay for a unit of the good,\nbut that same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time.\nThis means clean air is a finite resource in our world, especially if there continues to be an\nincrease in air pollution through carbon emissions.\nI hope this curbs your confusion!\nSincerely,\nA classmate eager to help.\nWord Count: 459\nWork Cited\nDepillis, Lydia. “‘We’re All Climate Economists Now.’” The New York Times, The New York\nTimes, 23 Jan. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/economy/climate-change-\neconomics.html.",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure First Draft\nDear Friend,\nI would be happy to help you better understand the concept of market failure.\nThis is when absent government intervention, the market fails to reach efficiency on its own. Up\nuntil this point, we had been under the impression that the efficient outcome always occurs at\nequilibrium. However, in the presence of a market failure the current equilibrium no longer\nmaximizes total surplus as it creates deadweight loss. Externalities are one of the main forms of\nmarket failure. These occur when the actions of a consumer or producer affect a third party not\ninvolved in the transaction. A negative externality, or external cost, is when these actions harm\nthe unrelated party. This leads to overproduction in the market, with prices too low and quantities\ntoo high, as the external costs are not factored in. On the other hand, a positive externality, or\nexternal benefit, makes these unrelated third parties better off. In this case, there's\nunderproduction in the market, with both prices and quantities too low, as the external benefits\nare not taken into account.\nThe other three forms of market failure relate to types of goods. Excludable goods require\npayment for consumption, such as food at restaurants. When goods are rival in consumption,\nonly one person can use them at a time, like a chair in a classroom. Understanding these terms is\ncrucial to grasping why artificially scarce goods, common resources, and public goods are all\nforms of market failure. For starters, artificially scarce goods are excludable but non-rival in\nconsumption. Therefore, the marginal cost of giving another consumer access to the good is zero\nmeaning the efficient price would also be zero. Common resources are non-excludable but rival\nin consumption so the market tends to overuse these resources. Finally, public goods are both\nnon-excludable and non rivals in consumption. As a result, the market quantity is lower than the\nefficient one because consumers can benefit without paying, undervaluing the good.\nNow that I have provided a general overview of the concept, let's consider a real-world\nexample of market failure. In the article \"A New Surge in Power Use Is Threatening U.S.\nClimate Goals,\" a recent spike in electricity demand in the United States due to factors like the\nrise of data centers, increased manufacturing, and the growing popularity of electric vehicles is\ndiscussed. Efforts to address this surge lead to negative externalities, in the form of significant\nenvironmental harm. For example, the construction of new gas-fired power plants to meet the\nrising demand will result in increased greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change\nand its associated impacts such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and biodiversity loss.\nAdditionally, the reliance on fossil fuels prolongs the transition to cleaner energy sources like\nwind, solar, and nuclear power, hindering efforts to achieve sustainability goals. This scenario\nexemplifies market failure as the unregulated market fails to account for the full social costs\nassociated with increased electricity consumption, leading to inefficient outcomes and negative\nconsequences for society and the environment.\nWord Count: 500 words\nReferences\nPlumer, Brad, and Nadja Popovich. \"A New Surge in Power Use Is Threatening U.S. Climate\nGoals.\" The New Y ork Times, 14 Mar. 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html?se\narchResultPosition=10.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI heard that you are having a hard time understanding market failure. To start off, market failure\nis essentially defined as a market in which total surplus is not maximized, thus making it socially\ninefficient. Market failure can look many different ways, including international trade, positive\nand negative externalities, and instances regarding public goods, artificially scarce goods, or\ncommon resources. These scenarios lead to outcomes in which resources are not efficiently\nallocated and social welfare is not maximized. For ease of understanding, I have found an article\nto help explain the concept of market failure– looking specifically at a negative externality,\nwhich is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. This is also known\nas an external cost.\nThe article linked below discusses the volatile market for lithium and nickel, resources that are\nvital in the production of electric vehicles. Continuing, it details the “boom-and-bust cycle” that\nis commonly found in the metals market, which is a cycle in which prices of metals can soar\nwhen demand is high, and crash when supply exceeds demand. In this scenario with the lithium\nand nickel mines, producers have turned towards using lower cost, high pollution mines (Hoyle,\nSteinberg). The pollution produced from these high-pollution producing mines, in itself is a\nnegative externality. This is because the market does not account for the environmental damage\nthat is caused by the switch to the high-pollution mines, and is an uncompensated cost that the\nproducers impose on other civilians, as pollution affects all humans.\nBut how does this look on a graph? We can look at the supply and demand curves, where supply\nis the producer's marginal cost. The intersection of the two is the market equilibrium price and\nquantity. Now, with a negative externality, we introduce an external cost (pollution) that\nincreases the cost of production (external cost on other humans), which is not reflected in the\nsupply curve (Private Cost). This is called the Social Marginal Cost curve, and is located above\nthe original supply curve displaced by the magnitude of the external cost. Now the socially\nefficient point, or the point where SMC intersects demand, represents the true efficient quantity\nand efficient price and the effect of the externality. When we introduce the externality, the total\nsurplus decreases. This is because the negative externality increases the overall costs to society,\nwhich are not captured by the private costs of production. On the graph, when there is a negative\nexternality, the total surplus is reduced as the SMC curve is above the supply curve, and the new\ntotal surplus is the area between the demand curve and the SMC curve.\nHope this helps,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 448\nWorks Cited\nHoyle, Rhiannon, and Julie Steinberg. “The Boom in Battery Metals for Evs Is Turning to Bust.”\nThe Boom in Battery Metals for EVs Is Turning to Bust, The Wall Street Journal, 19 Feb.\n2024,\nwww.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/the-boom-in-battery-metals-for-evs-is-turnin\ng-to-bust-5630493c.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/the-boom-in-battery-metals-for-evs-is-turning\n-to-bust-5630493c?mod=Searchresults_pos14&page=1",

      "essay": "Market failure is when a market, without any intervention, does not achieve maximum\ntotal surplus, failing to be efficient, even at equilibrium! A few examples include, common\nresources, public goods, artificially scarce goods, and externalities.\nThe first three types work under a similar framework. Goods have two attributes:\nexcludable, meaning that suppliers can prevent those who don’t pay for a good from consuming\nit, and rival in consumption, meaning that a single unit of this good can not be used by multiple\npeople at once.\nCommon resources are non-excludable but rival in consumption with an example being\nwater. This is a market failure as people overconsume common resources, but it has a larger\nsocial marginal cost, as consuming that good will take it away from somebody else and can lead\nto scarcity.\nArtificially scarce goods are nonrival and excludable, a good example being streaming\nservices. Because there is no additional cost in another person using this resource, the efficient\nprice for these products is 0. However, producers don’t set prices that low as they need money to\nmake content or create the good, causing a market failure.\nPublic goods are nonrival and nonexcludable so people will naturally not privately\ncontribute as much as they should for the good. An example would be national defense, and this\nmarket failure brings a need for government intervention, like in this case, a government that\nforces us all to pay taxes.\nThen, we have postive and negative externalities. A positive externality is a benefit that\nsociety receives and individual or firm without that individual receiving compensation.\nV accinations are an example of this as it not only brings benefit to the individual who got\nvaccinated but also to the rest of society as every person who gets a vaccine lowers the rate of\ntransmission. This is a market failure because we don’t consider positive externalities when\nmaking a purchase and as a result, as a society we under consume these things, leading to less\nsocietal surplus.\nFinally, we have negative externalities. This is a cost that and individual imposes on\nsociety when participating in the market. Because we don’t consider these harmful externalities\nwhen making our purchases, we tend to participate too much in this market, leading to a lower\ntotal surplus due to the negative effects.\nA recent example concerns pollution and an industrial plant located just outside of\nJacksonville, Florida. This plant operated in the 1990s and left large amounts of toxic waste\nburied int the ground, and those contents, as well as air and water pollution from the factory,\nhave left disastoruous consequences, including “a pattern of cancers, heart disease, birth defects\nand genetic disorders.” (Blumetti) This is an example of a negative externality, a negative cost on\nsociety due to a transaction. We don’t consider this societal impact when buying a good, and as\nresult, we over consume the good, leading to the effects mentioned above. This is a market\nfailure as this negative effect ultimately lowers our societal total surplus.\nWord Count: 500\nBibliography\nBlumetti, Jordan.\n“A Florida neighborhood says an old factory made them sick.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failure occurs when without any intervention the market fails to reach the eﬃcient\noutcome even at equilibrium. As you know, eﬃciency is when the market reaches its maximum\ntotal surplus. Total surplus is maximized where marginal benefit intersects marginal cost.\nHowever, externalities (a type of market failure) can cause external marginal costs and external\nmarginal benefits. These prevent the market from being able to reach eﬃciency at equilibrium.\nAn example of this can be seen in Manhattan, where a tiny forest is being planted in the middle\nof the city (Buckley). This mini forest will provide a habitat for insects and wildlife, as well as\nabsorbing carbon and cleaning the air. A positive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm\nconfers on others without receiving compensation (Dudley). This tiny forest is a positive\nexternality because people who did not pay for it will benefit from it. iDig2Learn and other\norganizations are paying for and implementing the tiny forest, but the general public will benefit\nfrom it because it will improve the air quality for those in the surrounding area. As I mentioned\nearlier, this externality creates an external marginal benefit. This means that the supply curve\nremains the social marginal cost; however, the social marginal benefit is the demand curve in the\nmarket plus the external marginal benefit caused by the externality. This causes the market\nequilibrium to result in too few units of the good compared to the eﬃcient outcome.\nIn addition to being a positive externality, the new tiny forest is also a common resource.\nCommon resources are nonexcludable, meaning consumers do not have to pay producers for the\ngood, and rival in consumption, meaning the same unit of the good can not be used by more than\none person at the same time. The tiny forest is nonexcludable because no one has to pay to visit\nit. It is a rival in consumption because only a limited number of people can visit the forest at a\ntime, an unlimited number of people can not fit in the forest at once. Because the tiny forest is\nnonexcludable, it will face the free-rider problem. Because payment is not required to benefit\nfrom the tiny forest, most consumers will choose to avoid payment. Some may choose to donate\nto the foundations creating the tiny forest, but most will simply visit it without compensating the\nfoundations. This also leads to market failure, because in order to reach the eﬃcient outcome\nconsumers must pay for the good. Because the tiny forest is a positive externality and a common\nresource, it causes market failure.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 432\nWork Cited\nBuckley, Cara.\n“Coming Soon to Manhattan, a Brand-New Tiny Forest.\n” The New York Times,\nThe New Y ork Times, 11 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/climate/tiny-forest-roosevelt-island.html.\nDudley, Mitchell.\n“Externalities.\n” 5 March 2024, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

      "essay": "Hey Friend,\nI know this topic can be a little tough, especially with its various nuances, but I hope I can help\nyou understand it! Feel free to reach out to me if something doesn’t make sense or if you want a more\nin-depth explanation.\nI’m going to start by discussing the concept of market failure in general. First we are going to\nlook at extranalities. There are two types of extranalities: positive and negative. With extranalities, the\nconsumers and producers do not realize that their actions are impacting an unrelated third party. This\nmakes the market inefficient because there is a external cost or benefit related to this extranality that\noccurs which means that the market is no longer efficient at equilibrium. This is considered a market\nfailure since the market is unable to reach the efficient outcome and maximze the total surplus.\nNext we’re going to look at a Wall Street Journal article called,\n“GM Doesn’t Tell the Truth\nAbout EVs” and we’ll walk through it together to find the example of a market failure. This article\ndiscusses the false promises that GM makes to its consumers and the world about attempting to switch to\nselling only not sell gas-powered cars by the year 2035. However, it discusses how behind this promise,\nGM continues to make the majority of its profits by selling its gas-powered vehicles. This results in a\nnegative extranality GM continues to produce more and more gas powered vehicles which results in\npollutants for the rest of the environment. Y ou and me would be part of this unrelated third party, the\nenvironment, who get negatively impacted even though we are not directly involved in this process.\nAn interesting nuance of this article is that GM is attempting to sell more EV’s however, they are\nfailing in this goal. If they proved to be successful in this goal, and lowered their sales of gas vehicles and\nincreased those of EV’s, then this situation would switch from a negative extranality to a positive one. As\na unrelated third party, we would then actually benefit from this change in sales and the efficient amount\nbe above the equilibrium amount.\nAnother aspect to discuss when looking at market failures is what type of good something is. In\nthis situation, the sale of cars is a public good, since it is excludable by price and\nnon-rivial-in-compeition. A market may allocate this good efficiently, however as we see in this case, the\nmarket is not able to do this.\nIn terms of negative externalities, the government often attempts a few methods to pursue and\nachieve efficiency. In our example, they can implement environmental standards for each gas powered\nvehicle, or they can add pigouvian taxes which tax each car, or they can implement a quota which limits\nhow many gas cars are produced. They can also implement a subsidy which incentivises consumers to\nbuy more EV’s.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 483\nWork Cited\nJenkins, Holman W.\n“GM Doesn’t Tell the Truth About EVs.\n” Wall Street Journal, 8 March 2024,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-doesnt-tell-the-truth-about-electric-vehicles-auto-industry-clima\nte-policy-92e25d01?mod=Searchresults\n_pos1&page=1.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failure occurs when the allocation of goods/services by a market is not efficient at\nthe market equilibrium, leading to deadweight loss. This can result from externalities, which are\nwhen the actions of consumers and producers have unintended consequences on society that are\nnot reflected in market prices. Additionally, market failures occur through goods that differ from\nprivate goods. Excludable means it's possible to prevent people from benefiting unless they pay,\nwhile rival means the consumption by one individual diminishes the quantity available. Private\ngoods are both excludable and rival, making them straightforward to allocate. Other types of\ngoods such as public goods (national defense) are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, leading to\nunderproduction; common resources (fish stocks) are rivalrous but non-excludable, leading to\noveruse; and artificially scarce goods (streaming services) are excludable but non-rivalrous,\nleading to underconsumption.\nNegative externalities include an overgrown front yard diminishing the value of nearby\nproperties, or the pollution resulting from electricity production and consumption leading to acid\nrain in areas not directly involved in the transaction. The article “How air pollution prevents\npollinators from finding their flowers” specifically highlights how “air pollution alters the sweet\nsmell of flowers and disrupts the cues nocturnal pollinators use to find nectar” (Grandoni 2004).\nAs consumers and producers in the electricity market operate, they fail to account for the\nexternal cost of their emissions, which leads to decreased pollination efficiency. This negative\nexternality impacts society by reducing the reproductive success of plants and the survival of\npollinator species, thereby affecting agricultural productivity and ecosystem health through\nreduced biodiversity, decline in crop yields, and economic losses for pollination dependent\nindustries. As the cost of the negative externality is not included in the cost of producing and\nconsuming electricity, the supply curve does not accurately reflect the true social marginal-cost\nof production. Consequently, the market equilibrium is set at producers marginal-cost and the\nequilibrium is above efficiency, causing deadweight loss due to overproduction.\nTo internalize the externality, several strategies can be employed. The Coase Theorem\nsuggests bringing all affected parties together to negotiate. However, high transaction costs\nassociated with pollution make it impossible to gather all parties and the government must step\nin. Environmental Standards allow the government to directly implement rules. A ban on\npollution emissions regulates the externality, whereas a ban on electricity production regulates\nthe market. Pigouvian Taxes offer an alternative approach by imposing a tax that equals the cost\nof the externality, either on the emission of pollutants (taxing an amount of pollution released) or\non the production side (taxing an amount of energy produced). Tradable Emission Quotas on the\nexternality allow the government to issue a fixed number of permits to allow limited quantities of\nemissions. Similarly, Production Quotas on the market allow the government to limit the\nproduction of electricity to a certain quantity. Regardless, the externality must be internalized to\nreflect the true cost of pollution, thereby aligning the market to the efficient outcome and\nensuring no detrimental effects associated with agriculture/pollination.\nSincerely,\nY our Econ 101 Friend\nWord Count: 497\nReference:\nGrandoni, D.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nYou asked for my help with understanding market failure, so I have found an example of\na negative externality that I will walk you through. As a reminder, a negative externality is a cost\naffecting an uninvolved party, and a market failure is when the equilibrium point is not the most\nefficient outcome.\nThe article that I found in The New York Times has to do with a cancerous gas that is\nused to sterilize medical equipment in manufacturing facilities (Friedman, 2024). The article\nstates that there are around 90 of these plants across the country, and almost 13 million people\nlive near them. The ethylene oxide gas is leaking from these plants and posing a serious health\nrisk to the nearby population, and the economic cost of this has not been taken into consideration\nby the manufacturers. A negative externality is where an uninvolved party bears unintended costs\nof a market. In this case the health risks of the gas present a negative externality on the nearby\npopulation.\nYou already know what supply and demand curves look like. The social marginal cost is\nhow you represent negative externalities in the supply and demand model. While the supply\ncurve only considers the costs to the producer, the social marginal cost considers the external\ncosts; in this case the negative health effects of using the gas. Because of this, the social marginal\ncost curve will be offset above the supply curve. In this model, the equilibrium point is the same\nas what it’s always been, but the efficient outcome is actually at the intersection of the demand\nand social marginal cost curves. This means that the efficient outcome is at a lower quantity and\nhigher price than the where the equilibrium point lies. A disparity between the efficient and\nequilibrium point is what defines market failure.\nTo recap, medical manufacturers are using a toxic gas in their production that is being\nreleased into the local environment. This has a negative effect on local populations, and this\ndamage has an economic cost. Because this cost is not accounted for by anyone involved in the\nmarket, it is considered to be a negative externality. If this cost is accounted for, then the most\nefficient outcome is at a higher price and lower quantity than where the equilibrium is. This is\nconsidered a market failure because the equilibrium point does not create the most efficient\noutcome.\nYour friend,\nName\nWord Count: 402\nE.P.A.

      "essay": "Dearest friend,\nUnderstanding the basic principles of market failure is essential, as there are many market\nfailures in the world around us. In simple terms, a market failure occurs when absent of any\nintervention, even government intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome even\nin equilibrium. When the market does not achieve an efficient outcome, it does not maximize its\ntotal surplus. With this, it is important to know that certain factors must be present for a market\nfailure to occur. These factors are positive externalities, negative externalities, common\nresources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nIn order to further explain the concept of market failure, the following example will\ndemonstrate a market failure stemming from a negative externality. A negative externality is an\nuncompensated cost an individual or firm imposes on others. It is essentially an external cost. An\nexample of this is pollution, as companies produce polluting chemicals, affecting people who are\nnot a part of the production process. Essentially, the decision-makers are not the only ones who\nface the cost. The example comes from a New Y ork Times article that discusses the successes\nand failures of Biden's climate law. In broad terms, in this article, a market failure is introduced\nin the market for renewable energy.\nWhen further assessing this, it is clear that the underlying cause for the market failure is\nfrom a negative externality due to pollution and climate change caused by many industries that\nhave produced nonrenewable and pollutant energy. Following this assessment, one must also\nidentify the victims of the negative externality. In this case, the negative externality is then\nplaced on the citizens of the United States as a whole, as their lives are damaged by the\nchemicals in the air. More specifically, a main third party affected is other companies/industries\nin the US that must now find ways to quickly produce nonpolluting energy in order to combat\nthe damage that the past polluting energy has done. This unfairly places a great burden of\nexpenses on the companies as they must pay for an issue they did not create. Because of this, the\nmarket is not acting at its prime efficiency.\nThis example of market failure is only one of many real-world market failures, especially\nthose pertaining to pollution.

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\nI hope this email finds you well, I understand that you are having trouble with the term “market failure”, well I have found an article that may help you better understand the term.The article from The New York Times titled \"Many Maine Households Are Installing Climate-Friendly Heat Pumps,\" published on March 2, 2024, by Cara Buckley\n\nMarket failure refers to a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is inefficient, leading to an outcome that is not optimal for society as a whole. In other words, the market fails to produce the quantity and distribution of goods and services that would maximize societal welfare.A form of market failure is externalities, positive in this case, which are the unintended side effects of economic activities affecting third parties.\n\nThe article talks about the change from traditional oil-based heating systems to climate friendly heat pumps in Maine. The way these pumps are set up, they extract heat from outside air and compress it and put it back into the house, making it cheaper, reducing environmental impact compared to oil furnaces. As well as cost, these heat pumps also help with reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe way this article is related to market failure is through the reliance on heating oil has resulted in the negative externalities of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Ever since the switch to heat pumps in Maine there has been less contribution of pollution and greenhouse gasses emitted to the environment, which is now a positive externality.\n\nThe New York Times interviewed Kaylan Mclaughlin and recently made the decision to switch from oil-based heating to pumps. In her interview she disclosed that she used to spend $400 every four weeks to have oil delivered to her house, but since then that has been a cost that she doesn’t need to keep paying. Ms. Mclaughlin switched to heat pumps not for the environmental benefit but because of what she had heard, she claims that her house is more evenly heated and she spends less weekly. The switch also just happens to have the benefit of being better for the environment. \n\nAn externality refers to the unintended side effect of economic activities that affect third parties who are not involved in the transaction, in this case pollution was the negative externality and the switch which is reducing the pollution and greenhouse gasses being emitted into the atmosphere is an example of a positive externality.

      "essay": "1\nDearest Classmate,\nI hope that all is well with you. Let me give you a bit of an explanation. Market failure occurs\nwhen, in a sense, the market fails to be efficient outside of government intervention. As we have\ndiscussed, pursuing efficiency involves maximizing total surplus, defining a maximized\nculmination of consumer and producer surplus in the market. Market failure occurs when total\nsurplus is not as high as it could potentially be because of some confounding factor. This is\nwhere market failure comes into play. There are a large number of market failures that can take\nhold, ranging from the market’s allocation of non-private goods to market power scenarios, but\ntoday we hone in on one central kind: positive and negative externalities. An externality takes\nplace when the production of a particular good or service within a market affects an uninvolved\nthird party, either negatively or positively depending on the situation at hand. The effect is\ntypically placed upon the third party without the producer of said externality being aware, but\nonce this effect takes place it has a vast impact on the nature of the good’s market. When we\nobserve the emergence of externalities, the quantity being exchanged in the market at the\nequilibrium price no longer equates to the efficient quantity. This means that, when supply\nintersects demand, the quantity pictured in this situation is not necessarily the quantity that is\nmaximizing our total surplus. When the market fails to account for an externality, we either\nunderproduce, as is the case with a positive externality, or overproduce, correlating with a\nnegative externality. One case where a negative externality takes hold denotes itself in the recent\nFayetteville plant situation in North Carolina. This power plant, situated on the Cape Fear River\nin North Carolina, has led to large amounts of contaminated wastewater making their way to\nNorth Carolina communities. The releasing of PFAS, man-made chemicals, into these\n2\ncommunities, has caused a host of problems relating to sources of drinking water. Residents have\nbecome outraged and have therefore taken a stance against Chemours, the company behind the\nplant (Hiroko 1). This scenario denotes a perfect example of a negative externality. Pollution is\none of the primary examples of a negative externality in a market due to the fact that it is vastly\nnegative everytime. Because of the Fayetteville plant’s production methods, an uninvolved and\nunaccountable third party (in this case, North Carolina residents) is negatively affected. The\nmarket is not accounting for this negative externality and the plant is therefore likely\noverproducing, pointing to the efficient quantity for production being lower than the current\nquantity delineating in the market. We can see from this scenario how a negative externality\nplays out in the market, and you can assume that a positive externality purveys a positive effect\non a third party, contrasting to the pollution scenario we just discussed. I hope that this\ninformation was found useful to you. Best of luck!\nWord Count: 492\n3\nWorks Cited\nTabuchi, Hiroko, “North Carolina ‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N.

      "essay": "Subject: Examining Market Failures Through the Lens of Nature: A Positive Externality\nDear: Friend in Economics 101\nFrom: Fellow Economics 101 Student\nDate: March 26, 2024\nA market failure occurs when a free market inefficiently distributes goods and services.\nThus far, Dr. Dudley has covered how some types of goods and externalities—activities that\naffect a third party unrelated to their production or consumption—prevent efficient market\nallocation.\nTo the first point, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods all result\nin market failures. Common resources, such as clean water, are costless but limited in quantity,\nrendering them prone to over-consumption. Public goods, like snow removal, are free, and more\nthan one person can consume the same unit of a good at the same time, which disincentivizes the\nprivate market from providing these goods because they cannot profit from doing so. Artificially\nscarce resources, including cable television, come with an initial cost, but once created, an\ninfinite number of people can consume them simultaneously. These products should be\ncomplementary because suppliers face no marginal cost in providing access to another person.\nHowever, sellers purposefully charge a price above the efficient quantity to maximize their profit\nat the expense of making artificially scarce goods under-consumed by society.\nTo the second point, externalities cause market failure through excess consumption or\ninsufficient usage. Negative externalities, such as pollution, lead to over-consumption because\npolluters do not bear the cost of compromising the health of people uninvolved in their\nproduction. Positive externalities, like environmental organizations, fall subject to under-\nconsumption because no one reimburses them for their work. The New York Times article\n“Nature Has Value. Could We Literally Invest in It?” demonstrates this cycle by examining the\nways in which nature behaves as a positive externality (Depillis 1).\nReporter Lydia Depillis shares the recent push from a group of progressive investors to\nrequire companies to assign a specific market value to nature. The investors argue that forests’\nadvantages–namely climate regulation and storage of carbon dioxide emissions– extend to all\nmembers of society rather than just the leading NGOs supporting their preservation (Depillis 2).\nIn accordance with all positive externalities, these climate change organizations operate without\ncompensation for their good deeds and thus suffer from inefficiently low production, ultimately\ndisturbing the market equilibrium. The government generally intervenes to rectify externalities by\ntaxing production that harms others or subsidizing services that generate spillover benefits. In this\ncase, legislators could enforce the investors’ proposition to establish a price polluters must pay to\noffset their environmental damage or fund conservation groups. An objective value for nature and\ngovernment subsidies can work in tandem to restore market equilibrium and correct this market\nfailure [412].\nWorks Cited\nDepillis, Lydia. “Nature Has Value.

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\nI hope you are doing well. I’m writing to you to tell you about what we learned it class,\nspecifically market failure. I will try to explain it briefly and identify some of the ways markets\ncan fail. I will also give you an example from an article I read that highlights the concept of\nmarket failure.\nA market failure occurs when (without intervention) a market fails to reach an efficiency.\nIn this case, this means that total surplus is not maximized even at equilibrium. When this\nhappens, usually government intervention is needed to reach the efficient quantity (again, which\nis now not always at equilibrium). We can measure this by identifying the total surplus at\nequilibrium, and comparing it to the total surplus of the efficient quantity, the difference between\nthe two being deadweight loss.\nIn a Wall Street Journal article titled “Sneaky Drivers Dodging Toll Cameras Cost\nAuthorities Millions”, Scott Calvert explores how some drivers are avoiding paying toll fees for\nhighways. While roads may normally be seen as a public good, since toll roads are both\nexcludable (toll booth gates) and rivalrous (more cars means more traffic and slower speed)\nthey therefore are private. One example mentioned in the article is that the New York City MTA\nlost $21 million dollars to people avoiding paying tolls by hiding their license plates so they can’t\nbe fined. This creates market failure because some consumers are not paying for their fair\nshare of the toll roads, and while you might not think it harms anyone, it does. The New York\nCity MTA said that only 1.5% of all toll transactions were unbillable, yet that meant that over $20\nmillion dollars was,\n“money unavailable for electric buses and needed upgrades”\n. As a private\ngood, if people enjoy toll ways without paying, the producer does not get compensated for\ncreating the good taking away from the total surplus. This imposes a cost on others that is not\ncompensated for, which we learned is called a negative externality. also known as an external\ncost, since the people who avoid paying the toll are not factored into the price. Because of this,\ntoll roads fail to fully be a private good, and thus will be inefficient.\nI hope this example and brief explanation helped.

I understand your concern about keeping up with the Econ 101 coursework, especially the idea of market failure, which can initially be confusing. Let me offer some insight into this problem by sharing a recent article I came upon that helped me understand the concept a bit more! Market failure occurs when a free market allocates products and services inefficiently, resulting in resource misallocation. Externalities, common resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods are all potential causes of misallocation. These are terms you may have heard in class but have yet to fully comprehend. \n\nRecently, I saw a helpful editorial from The Wall Street Journal titled, “Once America’s Hottest Housing Market, Austin Is Running in Reverse” by Will Parker, published March 18th, 2024. You can access the article through this link: Once America’s Hottest Housing Market, Austin Is Running in Reverse - WSJ. This article depicts a noteworthy example of market failure, specifically the housing market in Austin, Texas. In this instance, the Austin housing market is undergoing a dramatic collapse following a period of rapid growth and overbuilding. Externalities are a crucial part of market failure that the paper discusses as they are the unforeseen repercussions of economic activity that impact persons not directly participating in the transaction. In Austin's housing market, the fast construction of luxury apartment complexes and single-family houses has resulted in an excess supply, prompting landlords to provide incentives such as free rent to draw in renters. \n\nThe article highlights the issue of overvaluation in Austin's housing market, with property prices still much higher than what the city's underlying economic patterns would normally sustain. The disparity between home prices and economic fundamentals shows market inefficiency, in which prices do not adequately reflect the true worth of houses. In addition, the Austin rental market has been impacted, with rents falling dramatically over the last year due to an excess of flats. This overstock has increased competition among landlords and resulted in lower rental rates, reducing the profitability of real estate investments in the area.\n\nFinally, the Austin housing market provides a strong example of market failure, as evidenced by overbuilding, overvaluation, and resource misallocation. Understanding these processes is critical for officials and market participants seeking to remove inefficiencies and encourage long-term growth in real estate markets. I hope this example clarifies the concept of market failure for you, and reach out to me if you have any more questions or require extra explanation.\n\n\nBest, \nYour Friend.\n\nWord Count: [426]\n\n\n",

In other words, someone who is not a part of the production nor consumption process is\nharmed, creating a cost that is not accounted for in the market.\n“Pollution Drives Another Great Migration: [Op-Ed]” portrays how pollution created by\nthe smokestacks of nearby refineries and factories, particularly in Black communities, drives\nmigration to areas with lower pollution levels. The article describes the decline in overall health\nof the individuals living in these highly polluted and dense areas as a result of the fumes, which\nhas further prompted the “Great Migration” of these communities to safer and healthier areas.\nThe broader impact that these high pollution levels has on these vulnerable populations provides\nan excellent example of a negative externality as it illustrates how the costs of pollution, such as\nhealth problems and decreased quality of life, are not fully borne by those who produce or\nconsume the pollution, but are instead passed on to others in the form of uncompensated harm\nand migration pressures.\nPollution as a negative externality exemplifies the broader concept of a market failure in\nthat it creates an additional cost, one not accounted for in the market transactions for the good\nbeing produced, leading to an inefficient allocation of resources and an underestimation of the\ntrue costs of production for the mentioned refineries/factories.

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nHi Friend,\nExternalities in the market can cause market failure. Market failure is when the market,\non its own, fails to reach the optimum quantity to maximize surplus in the economy (Dudley).\nThe place where the economy maximizes surplus is when the social marginal benefit equals the\nsocial marginal cost. The market failure found in the article is pollution, which is a negative\nexternality. A negative externality is “[a]n uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes\non others. Also known as External cost” (Dudley). The topic of the article is that multiple states\nare suing the Environmental Protection Agency for increasing restrictions on the size of fine\nparticulate matter that they can create. The article talks about the negative externality of\npollution, which is a market failure.\nAccording to the article, “Nearly Half the Sue E.P .A. Over New Limits on Deadly\nPollution” by Lisa Friedman the new regulation on pollution is believed to save up to $46 billion\nin net health benefits within the first year they are put in place. This $46 billion in net health\ncosts to the people that were not making the decisions previously was not taken into account\nwhen the market was tending to its market equilibrium quantity. This means that the market\nequilibrium quantity is too high, because it does not take into account the external cost, the up to\n$46 billion in net health cost. This negatively affects the economy, and this external cost needs to\nbe added to the supply curve, to create a Social Marginal Benefit line and the place where this\nSocial Marginal Benefit line intersect the demand curve will be the efficient quantity in the\nmarket that maximizes total surplus for everyone combined, even those that are not actively\ninvolved in this market.\nThe government should get involved in this market to make sure that the market reaches\nits efficient quantity for all of society. Also, if the government estimated the right amount of\nmoney for the social cost that is affecting the people who are negatively affected by the\npollution, and makes the factories and those profiting from it pay for the damages, and directly\nreimburses the people who were negatively affected, the market will reach an efficient outcome.\nBut the government has to get involved because not every single person that is negatively\naffected by the pollution can come together to discuss what that cost is with marginally low\ntransportation costs. So the government needs to estimate this cost and refund the people that are\naffected by the pollution.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nWord Count 429\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. \"Externalities.\" ECON 101, Accessed: March 25, 2024 University of\nMichigan.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nRegarding your inquiry about an example of market failure, I would like to present the\nfollowing: Administration to Fine Oil and Gas Companies for Excess Methane. The article\nincludes a great example of market failure due to an externality. Externalities are essential when\ntrying to understand one of the factors that can lead to a failed market. An externality is an\nindirect cost or benefit from a market's operations on another party. There are two types of\nexternalities: positive and negative. A positive externality is when there is some external benefit\nfrom a market that may not have been anticipated. An example of this is when an individual goes\nto receive a vaccination for themselves; they indirectly protect other people, and therefore, there\nis an unexpected benefit. A negative externality means that there is some external cost from the\nmarket. A very common negative externality is pollution. For example, a farmer uses chemicals\non their crops to keep bugs away, and during a heavy rainstorm, there is runoff into the nearby\nwater source; the people who consume that water can get sick, and therefore, there is an external\ncost.\nIn the article I provided earlier, there is a negative externality in the market from\npollution. The article describes a potential government intervention in the oil and gas industry\nbecause of their excessive methane emissions. In this case, the market is the oil and gas industry,\nand the other party affected would be an inhabitant of Earth. The market is producing goods that\nare essential to our daily lives. However, in production, there is an unexpected cost in methane\nemissions. The oil and gas market is experiencing market failure due to this negative externality.\nWhen a market fails, it does not reach the efficient outcome of maximizing total surplus.\nIn this case, the unexpected cost, in the form of pollution, makes the market inefficient due to the\nhigh social marginal cost. Social marginal cost is the amount that society has to pay for\nsomething to be produced and is always present when there is a negative externality. The\nmethane emissions from the oil and gas market can damage the planet's environment, eventually\nharming organisms on Earth, which is the price we have to pay. This external cost throws the\nmarket out of efficiency, and since the total surplus is no longer maximized, the market is failing.\nIt is important to mention that externalities are not the only type of market failure. We\nalso see failed markets with common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. To\nunderstand why these are in market failure, defining excludable and rival in consumption is\nimportant. Excludable means that a resource is not freely available, and rivalry is when people\nconsume a good, preventing others from doing the same. Each of the goods listed shows a failed\nmarket since some factor prevents efficiency, whether it be excludability or high rivalry.\nBest,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 484\nWorks Cited\nFriedman, L.

If you could just take a few minutes and give this letter as well as the attached article a read, I think I will be able to fill in most of the gaps for you. \nThe first thing to know about market failure is that the efficient quantity will not be the same as the equilibrium quantity. The reason behind this is because at equilibrium in a market containing a market failure, total surplus is not being maximized. Market failures can occur in a few different situations. These include markets that pertain to any good that is not a private good, or any good with a positive or negative externality associated with it. I would like to take a little time and expand on how a negative externality ultimately causes a market failure. \nFirst, it's important for me to mention that a negative externality is a cost that is experienced by someone not involved in the market. In an article by the New York Times, author Max Bearak talks about a situation where the US is going to start sending gas to a port in Mexico in order to sell gas to Asia more efficiently. This strategy comes with the negative externality of harming the environment, an entity that is not involved in the gasoline market. In this particular case, the environment could be negatively affected in a few different ways, namely potential pipeline leaks as well as increased shipping traffic in the Gulf of California. \nTo figure out why a negative externality classifies as a market failure, it is important to understand that the efficient outcome of a market is where the social marginal cost is equal to the social marginal benefit. In the case of a negative externality, the social marginal benefit is the same as the demand, while the social marginal cost curve has the same slope as the supply curve, but is shifted to the left. Therefore the intersection of the social marginal cost and social marginal benefit will occur at a lower quantity than the equilibrium quantity. \nTo correct for a negative externality, there are a few common strategies that are generally effective. The government can impose a tax on either the good or on the amount of pollution. A tax on the good can be easier to measure, but is not always fair to people who can produce the good at a lower rate of pollution. On the other hand, a tax on the quantity of pollution can be technically hard or even impossible to accurately measure in some cases. Another common strategy is for the government to put a quota on either the good or the pollution, which has a very similar effect to that of a tax.\nI hope that after reading this you have gained a better understanding of market failure.\nSincerely,\nYour Friend\n\nWord count: 499\n\nSources:\nBearak, Max. “U.S. Gas Producers Are Racing to Sell to Asia. and Mexico Is Key.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 13 Feb. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/02/13/climate/mexico-natural-gas-biden.html. \n",

      "essay": "Subject: Understanding Market Failure\nDear classmate,\nI hope everything’s okay with your family emergency. I’m here to help you with Econ 101 while you’re\naway. Y ou mentioned that the term “market failure” is confusing to you so I’m going to do my best to\nexplain it to you using an example from a recent news article.\nMarket failure takes place when, absent any intervention, the market is unable to achieve the efficient\noutcome, even when it is in equilibrium. The efficient outcome is where total surplus is maximized. There\nare several reasons why this might happen, like when there are external costs or benefits that are not\naccounted for in the prices of goods and services, or when certain goods are not provided in optimal\nquantities.\nI found an interesting article from The Wall Street Journal that talks about how global carbon dioxide\nemissions hit a record high in 2023 despite efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources. This article\nillustrates a market failure as it is a classic example of a negative externality, where the costs of carbon\ndioxide emissions are not fully borne by the parties emitting them. The article mentions that the increase\nin emissions was largely due to extreme droughts, which led to a rise in fossil fuel use as hydroelectric\nproduction was hampered.\nIn this case, the use of fossil fuels to replace hydropower accounted for over 40% of the emissions\nincrease. Countries like India and China saw significant increases in emissions due to their heavy reliance\non coal and higher electricity demand following the post-pandemic economic recovery. Despite efforts to\ndeploy clean-energy technology, emissions from energy combustion in China rose by 5.2%, reaching 12.6\nbillion tons. On the other hand, advanced economies like those in Europe and the U.S. saw declines in\nemissions, thanks to a stronger deployment of renewables and energy-efficiency measures. However, the\ndeployment of clean-energy sources remains overly concentrated in these advanced economies and China,\nleaving emerging and developing economies behind.\nThe market failure here is due to the external cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which is a negative\nexternality. The external costs of carbon dioxide emissions, such as environmental degradation and health\nrisks, are not fully accounted for in the prices of fossil fuels and energy. As a result, there’s an\noverconsumption of these fuels, leading to higher emissions and exacerbating climate change. The global\nenergy market, particularly the market for fossil fuels and energy production is not generating as much\ntotal surplus as is possible by producing at the market equilibrium, as it is failing to account for the\nnegative externality.\nI hope this helps clarify the concept of market failure for you! Let me know if you have any questions or\nneed further explanation.\nBest,\nY our friend/classmate\nWord count: 453",

      "essay": "\nTo: my friend\nSubject: Re: Market Failure\n\nHi friend! \n\nI hear you need help understanding the concept of a market failure, and I’m here to help! For basic understanding, when a free market fails to allocate goods and services efficiently, it is referred to as a market failure. The laws of supply and demand govern how resources are distributed and how much products and services cost in a free market. Based on their own distinctive preferences and motivations, market participants, both producers and consumers, are free to choose what they want to produce, sell, or buy. Stated differently, the market system is unable to promote societal welfare through an efficient resource allocation. A number of factors, including externalities, monopoly power, information asymmetry, public goods, and incomplete markets, may contribute to this failure.\n\n\nIn the article, a new report shows that much of America will most likely be exposed to unhealthy air by the middle of this century. Some factors that are discussed in the article that contribute to this include automobile exhaust, wildfires, and factories.\n \nIn this particular situation, one market discussed is the market for gasoline for automobiles. The negative externality created in the market for gasoline is pollution. The effect of this externality is placed on people all around the world because everyone breathes the air with pollutants in the air. Thus, the external cost is the cost of the pollution in the air. When a negative externality is present, the free market doesn’t take into account the external cost and thus produces a quantity that’s too large and sells it for a price that’s too low. The individuals that bear the external cost are not a part of the market. For example in this article gasoline is sold at too low of a price with too large of a quantity being used. And the individuals who suffer from pollution (people all over the world) are not essentially part of the gasoline production and purchase transaction. In order to find the efficient or optimal price and quantity of gasoline (or any other good that creates pollution), we need to find where the demand curve intersects the marginal social cost curve. Within the marginal social cost, it includes the marginal external cost and the private marginal cost. Therefore the marginal social cost should be used to find where the optimal price and quantity are, or where the market’s efficient outcome is reached.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps!\n\nBest,\nYour friend \nWord count: 410\n",

I'm writing this\nemail to assist you in understanding the role of types of goods in a functioning economy, after\nyou missed lectures this past week. I chose an article that includes an example of a common\nresource (one of the four types of goods), to make this concept easier to understand.\nThe attached article tells the story of a criminal interaction that took place last week. Police\nfatally chased and shot a man that chased a mugger. The shooter fired at a fleeing man after his\nwallet was stolen. The officers rushed to the scene after receiving calls regarding the shooting.\nThis situation includes the common resource of police protection for a specific event. It is\nconsidered a common resource, because it is non-excludable, and rival in consumption. If a good\nis excludable, the supplier of that good cannot prevent people who do not pay for it from using it\n(Dudley 5). If a good is rival in consumption, it means that the same unit of the good cannot be\nconsumed by more than one person at the same time (Dudley 5). In the following paragraph I\nwill explain why this situation can be categorized into these two groups.\nThe whole city of Brooklyn was put in danger from this situation, not just those who were\ndirectly involved in the shooting. The people who were located in the city of Brooklyn at the\ntime of the shooting, who did not call the police, still receive protection without any cost. This\nsimple fact reveals that police protection for a specific event is non-excludable, since it reaches\nall of the residents of Brooklyn. However, on the other hand, this good is rival in consumption. A\nfew Brooklyn residents did decide to call the police at the sound of the shooting. Since these\nresidents are on the line with the police, the remaining residents are unable to have access to the\nsame officer. Since, the “good” of this specific police officer is reserved for the caller, this good\nis rival in consumption. Since this good is excludable and rival in consumption, it is categorized\nas a common resource.\nI hope that my explanation was clear, and can relieve some of the stress that you are feeling with\nyour family emergency.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nA perfectly efficient market would be one in which all surplus is maximized.\nHowever, this wouldn’t guarantee that everyone receives their best possible outcome, or\neven receives all they need to survive. Thus, we have “market failures,” or instances in\nwhich markets (without outside or government intervention) fail to be efficient.\nA real life situation that demonstrates market failure can be found in Andreoni\nManuela’s “Many Laws to Protect Sharks Have Backfired, Researchers Find,” an article\nhe wrote for The New York Times. The article details the policies implemented by over\n70% of countries regarding protecting sharks from “finning,” or the killing of sharks for\ntheir fin-meat. The article presents the policies to show how they haven’t helped curb\nthe killing of sharks, and have been so ineffective that many species have gone\nendangered.\nThis type of market failure can be labeled “common resource.” T o the fisherman,\nand to the people in general, the sharks are a non-excludable resource, meaning that\nthere is no barrier and no price stopping anyone from consuming the sea’s sharks.\nFurthermore, the sharks would be considered “rival in consumption” goods, meaning the\nshark is a good for which the same unit cannot be consumed by more than one person\nat the same time. Once a shark is hunted, gutted, and eaten, and cannot be consumed\nby anyone else. The way these two characteristics of the shark as a good play off one\nanother can explain why the shark market is in market failure. Since sharks are rival in\nconsumption (and aren’t an unlimited resource), not everyone can share the same\nshark. But since sharks are non-excludable, everyone has an equal right to access the\nsame shark deposits. The limited nature of the shark as a good gives it value )in trade\nas well as being a source of food), and the non-excludability of access to sharks meant\nsome would over-farm the sharks for its value. The reason this continued to happen and\nsharks became further endangered over time, even with policies being implemented, is\nthat the policies didn’t do enough. Many policies were aimed at making sharks a “more”\nexcludable resource, such as forcing hunters do catch them whole, but policies like this\nweren’t enough–shark value was high enough and the barrier-to-access-sharks low\nenough that too few people were excluded and sharks continued to be overfished.\nIn other common resource market failure cases, many show a similar pattern of\ninefficiency to this one–a population has free access to a resource of rivalrous value,\nmany use this free access to hoard as much of the good as possible (either to sustain\nthemselves or to collect capital), until the resource has been overconsumed, there is\nlittle-to-no supply and overwhelming demand, and the market has failed.\nWorks Cited\nAndreoni, Manuela. “Many Laws to Protect Sharks Have Backfired, Researchers\nFind.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 Jan. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/climate/shark-fins-overfishing.html.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope you're doing well! I stumbled upon an article that I think ties in perfectly with what we've\nbeen learning in Econ 101 – market failure. It discusses why journalism appears to be collapsing,\nand it's a prime example of how market forces can sometimes lead to inefficient outcomes.\nMarket failure is when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. The\nmarket fails to efficiently allocate resources to produce the goods and services that society\ndesires. There are various reasons for market failure, and one of them is the presence of\nexternalities, which are costs or benefits that affect third parties not directly involved in the\neconomic activity.\nThe article discusses the collapse of journalism, attributing it to market failure. One particular\nconcept from our Econ 101 class that resonates with this situation is the idea of public goods.\nPublic goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that once they are provided,\neveryone can benefit from them, and one person's consumption of the good does not diminish its\navailability to others.\nJournalism can be considered a public good. Think about it – when a news outlet publishes a\nstory, anyone can access and benefit from that information, regardless of whether they\ncontributed financially. This creates a free-rider problem, where individuals have an incentive to\nconsume the good without paying for it. As a result, the market fails to provide the optimal\nquantity of journalism because it's difficult for news organizations to capture the full value of\ntheir product through traditional revenue streams like subscriptions and advertising.\nAnother aspect at play here is the presence of externalities. Quality journalism often involves\ninvestigative reporting and holding powerful entities accountable. However, the benefits of such\nreporting extend beyond those who directly consume the news—society benefits from a\nwell-informed citizenry and a watchdog press that keeps institutions in check. Unfortunately, the\nmarket often undervalues these positive externalities, leading to underinvestment in journalism.\nThe collapse of journalism serves as a clear example of market failure, particularly through the\nlens of public goods and externalities. The market struggles to efficiently allocate resources to\nproduce journalism because of the inherent nature of news as a public good and the difficulty in\ncapturing the full societal benefits of quality reporting.\nI hope this clears up the concept of market failure using a real-world example.

In our class this week we\nlearned about various topics but for our third writing assignment, we must write about market\nfailure. Since you have missed classes, it's my responsibility to teach you about market failure\nand give you an example to help you better understand it.\nMarket failure happens when the market equilibrium is not efficient due to structural failures in\nthe market like Externalities, Market Power, and Non-Private goods. In the case of a market\nfailure, the overall group faces too many costs or receives too few benefits. To understand market\nfailure more in-depth, I will introduce you to externalities, especially negative externality.\nExternalities occur when the consumption of a good or service benefits or harms a third party.\nImagine this, there are three groups: consumer, seller, and third party who do not partake in the\nmarket but still exist on the side. Let's say we are in the pharmaceuticals market and we as in\nconsumer demand for a new medicine for a new disease and the producer of that medicine in a\ndifferent country is going through different trials making that medicine and as they are doing so\nthey are dumping all those failed medicines into the river or just in plain soil. That medicine that\nwas dumped can cause environmental hazards or pollution and people who live by that river or\nwasteland, people who aren't part of those in the market, are affected by it causing diseases, etc.\nThis is known as a negative externality, in which in a market the third party, who is neither buyer\nnor seller is being affected by the actions of the market. Now let's look at a real-life example of a\nnegative externality.\nThis article is from the NY time, i am going to provide you with the link so you can refer back to\nit the link. In this example, a Bitcoin mine in Arkansas is causing noise pollution caused by the\ndin from thousands of computers mining for Bitcoin. To make things worse the noise gets worse\nat night which causes the people living nearby health problems. The government did intervene to\nreduce this negative externality and the bitcoin mining owner responded by saying they are\nwilling to find a way to give back to the community.\nThis example should help you understand market failure and externality, how negative\nexternality affects the people who are not in the market for the product, and how it affects the\nefficiency of the market.\nBest,\nAnonymous101\nWords: 443\nSource:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html?searchResultPosi\ntion=12\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketfailure.asp#:~:text=A%20market%20failure%20r\nefers%20to,or%20receives%20too%20few%20benefits.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIn the recent Econ 101 classes we have learned a lot about market failure. We learned that there\nare four main types of market failure. These failures are externalities, common resources, private\ngoods, and artificially scarce resources. A market is considered a failure when it is not operating\nat a socially optimal output. After class I was reading the Wall Street Journal and came across\nthis article titled “How One Texas County is Fighting 43,000 Monkeys”, this article is a great\nexample of an externality market failure. An externality is an uncompensated cost that an\nindividual or firm imposes on others also known as an external cost. In this article, they explain\nan issue about a recent surge in research monkeys. There is a lot of controversy because these\nmonkeys are loud and carry diseases in a quiet community. The article explains to us that the\nrecent spike in the number of monkeys is due to a Chinese ban on exporting research animals\nduring the pandemic. This ban on exports creates a negative externality because the people are\nunhappy with the monkeys and the ban forces the U.S. to house more monkeys here because they\nare unable to internationally in China. In the article they state “But Stern and other neighbors,\nconcerned about their property values, worry the monkeys will spread disease and question how\ndead animals and animal waste will be handled.” This is a great example of an externality\nbecause many people are unhappy with being neighbors with these monkey farms and they are\nstating that there are too many monkey problems compared to the amount of productive research\nthese monkeys are providing. People are asking the government to step in here to help this\nexternality. From our recent Econ 101 classes I believe that the government can implement a tax\non the people selling the monkeys. I think implementing a tax would be effective because it will\nshift the supply curve to the left causing a smaller supply. For this externality to be fixed the\ngovernment must step in because they are the only ones that can regulate the market. The market\nequilibrium point is at a higher quantity than the socially optimal equilibrium point so the\ngovernment must step in and create a tax for the market to achieve the socially optimal\nequilibrium point. Overall, this externality would affect the economy because there is a\ndeadweight loss. After all, the optimal social output is not being achieved.\nFrom,\nClassmate\n(421 words)\nWork Cited\nHow One Texas County Is Fighting 43,000 Monkeys - WSJ,\nwww.wsj.com/science/environment/how-one-texas-county-is-fighting-43-000-monkeys-28\n3fa869.

      "essay": "1\n[Name]\nDr. Dudley\nEconomics 101\nMarch 21, 2024\nHello,\nI hope you are well. In this email, I will be catching you up to the market failure lecture\nby using an article that talks about this concept in detail through a real life example. The topic of\nmarket failure and externalities builds upon course material that relates to market equilibrium\nand total surplus, which we covered earlier in class.\nConsumers and producers are the two groups that are directly involved in the decision\nmaking process of economic activities. Externalities take into account the cost paid by a third\nparty that is not directly involved in the production and consumption process, but is still\nimpacted. If the third party is disadvantaged, it generates a negative externality, generating a\nsocial marginal cost, which accounts for this third party external cost. If the third party is\nadvantaged, it generates a positive externality, generating a social marginal benefit, which\naccounts for this third party external benefit. In the case of negative externalities, since there is\nno external benefit, the personal marginal benefit is considered the social marginal benefit. For\npositive externalities, since there is no external cost, the marginal cost is considered the social\nmarginal cost.The original market equilibrium does not account for these external costs, and thus\nfails to maximise total surplus. The efficient equilibrium, associated quantity and price is\n2\ndetermined at the point where the Social Marginal Cost intersects the Social Marginal Benefit\ncurve.\nTo explain further in the context of the real world, I will be using a New Y ork Times\narticle that highlights negative externality as the market failure and details the adverse impacts of\nmicroplastic pollution on the general public and future generations. The article Microplastics Are\na Big Problem, a New Film Warns, underscores the importance of taking into consideration the\nways in which production processes pose external cost to those that would otherwise be\nconsidered completely uninvolved. Microplastics are a byproduct of plastic production that are\nreleased into the environment which are extremely harmful and three times as likely and immune\ncells that come into contact are three times as likely to die as a result (Jacobs). These\nmicroplastic particles were identified in the human lungs and placenta as well. Since the particles\nin the environment can not be controlled directly or contained, everyone who breathes or is in\nclose proximity to these particles is impacted negatively. The extended detrimental effects to the\nhealth of future generations and the public is the cost that they have to bear as a result of this\nnegative externality.\nTo counteract such negative externalities, the government can intervene by engaging\nwith the externality directly (the microplastics itself), or the market from which the externality\nemerges (the plastic industry). This can be achieved through a limitation on the amount of\nmicroplastics that are released in the air to meet certain environmental standards or levying\nproduction quotas on the plastic industry; the government can also add taxes to discourage\npollution.\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n3\nWord Count: 490\n4\nWork Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times,\nThe New Y ork Times, 21 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResu\nltPosition=2",

      "essay": "Economics 101\nDoctor Dudley\nWriting Assignment #3\nMarch 24 2024\nWordcount: 453\n\nDear Friend,\nTo start, it is important to know that market failure occurs when the market on its own fails to be efficient. This means that without any other interventions, the market still cannot reach efficiency. Furthermore, there are various reasons and structural failures which explain why the market equilibrium is not efficient when the market is in failure. One example of a cause of market failure is the concept of externalities. Externalities are positive or negative impacts on parties who are unaffiliated with the decision-making process. Negative externalities indicate effects which have impacted the third parties negatively, while positive externalities indicate the opposite.\nI suggest reading the article “Secondhand smoke linked to rise in some dogs’ cancer risk” by Erin Blakemore to further cement your understanding of externalities and connect this concept to market failure. The real-world example of a negative externality in this article is sure to augment your learning. In this example, the market responsible for the market failure is the cigarette market (Blakemore, E.). Additionally, the market experiencing market failure is the canine cancer treatment/health market (Blakemore, E.). To reiterate, this particular market failure is classified as a negative market externality. Dogs are uninvolved in smoking yet being negatively impacted by the situation of secondhand smoke (Blakemore, E.).\nThe concept of positive and negative externalities is incredibly important to grasp in the context of market failure. However, there are other causes of said failure as well. Common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods are each intrinsically connected to market failure. Common resources are nonexcludable and rival goods/services. This means that nobody can be kept from the goods/services by being required to pay, for example. However, there are limited spaces. Public goods are both nonexcludable and nonrival. This means that there are no barriers to entry such as having to pay for admission, and there is also space for everyone. Lastly, artificially scarce goods are excludable and nonrival. This means that while there are barriers to access such as payment requirements, there is space for all. Common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods are all connected to market failure through various mechanisms, primarily due to the presence of externalities and the inability of markets to efficiently allocate resources or distribute goods/services evenly.\nIn each case, market failure occurs because traditional market mechanisms fail to allocate resources efficiently. Externalities, whether in the form of common resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods, lead to outcomes that are suboptimal for society. As a result, alternative mechanisms may be necessary to address said failures and achieve a more efficient allocation of resources. I hope that this explanation has been helpful; please don’t hesitate to reach out with further questions.\n\nSincerely, Ella\n\n\n\nReferences\nBlakemore, E. (2024, March 2).

      "essay": "Market failure describes an economic situation in which the allocation of resources in a market is not efficient. In a perfectly competitive market, the equilibrium price and quantity of a good is determined by the convergence of traditional supply and demand. This creates an equilibrium that satisfies the general social welfare. Market failures are created when this equilibrium is disrupted, which can be done through a couple different factors. \nOne factor that creates market failure is externalities, in which consumption of a market’s products causes harm to a third party. One example of this comes from pollution, which I’ll explore with a real-world example later. Another factor is public goods, which are goods that are accessible to the public and can’t have their consumption limited. Something like national security is funded with taxes by citizens and serves to benefit everyone, but there is no way to prohibit those who don’t pay taxes from also receiving the protections of national security. This means that the government usually has to pay for these kinds of services, leaving the success of this market up to them. There are also common goods, which are similar to public goods in the fact that no one can be prohibited from their consumption. Where they differ is that they rival in consumption, meaning that no more than one person can consume a unit of this good at a time. Examples of this include clean water, because anyone can access it at any time. The final form of market failure comes with artificially scarce goods. These are goods like digitally streamed music, which are artificially limited in their consumption. Producers limit its consumption only to paying customers, when distributing additional units actually comes at no cost to the producer. \nAn article in the Wall Street Journal (Niiler & Hiller, 2024) exhibits the principle of a market failure, specifically due to externalities. The article discusses a new pollution regulation enforced by the EPA, which specifically aims to further limit the volume of soot in the air. The EPA projects the effects that this new policy will have on national healthcare, predicting a prevention of 4,500 premature deaths and a savings of $46 billion in the healthcare industry through 2032. These projected savings represent a market failure in the healthcare industry, due to a positive externality which will improve societal quality of life. The healthcare industry will be spending far less than they otherwise would have, as a result of a decreased incidence of lung related health issues.\n \nReferences\nNiiler, E., & Hiller, J.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope you’re doing well, and this will help you understand the concept of market failure\nwith a real-world example. Market failures happen if the free market does not allocate resources\nwell in an independent manner. This might lead to net social welfare loss, which is when the\nbenefits to society are outweighed by the cost. For example, an article from the U.S. News\nsection of The Associated Press discusses a prominent externality. The article, \"Oil and Gas\nProducer to Pay Millions to US and New Mexico to Remedy Pollution Concerns,\" is about a\nnegative externality of environmental pollution in the Permian Basin, a region that produces\nlarge quantities of gas and oil. The link for the article is here.\nExternalities form when a company or person’s action somehow influences a party that\ndoes not bear any relationship with the business or individual or the related outcome. An\nexample can be an air pollution issue whereby anything that factories release into the air is\nharmful to the environment and the lives of the residents, but the factories do not remit such\ncosts at the end of the business. In other words, this is the negative effect of the market, which\nalways does not represent the value of the product since it concentrates on selling a lot without\nthinking of the environment.\nThe Apache Corporation faced punishment for its failure to monitor the earth's harmful\npollution levels when the norms existed for environmental safety. According to the reports of the\ninvestigations of a federal and state commission, the plant was committing polluting violations\nby not ensuring that they preserved the emissions at these places during their operation, and this\nworsened ground-level ozone and climate change. The authority compelled Apache to pay off\nthe fines and also to take steps to eventually enhance the community’s environment.\nFrom an economic perspective, the absence of Apachie's pollution control can be\nconsidered an indication of a classic market failure. The company's economy increased from not\nconsidering the treatment of pollutants, but instead, the environment paid for these damages;\ngenially, this was borne by the public and the ecosystem. Regulations and legal penalties are one\nof the economic policy tools of the government to deal with such missing markets by imposing\nexternal costs directly. Then the companies are motivated to reduce their emissions, and the\nresult is an increase in everybody’s welfare by eliminating those costs.\nSuch an example may hopefully give you a better understanding of how market failure\narises, and therefore governments usually react by taking measures like regulations and other\nmeans to eliminate those inefficiencies. Not all externalities cause negative outcomes for society;\npositive externalities such as vaccines give a positive benefit to society.\nBest,\n__________\n452 Words\nWorks Cited\nPress, Associated. “Oil and Gas Producer to Pay Millions to US and New Mexico to Remedy\nPollution Concerns.” US News & World Report, U.S. News & World Report, 2024,\nwww.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2024-02-13/oil-and-gas-producer-to-pay-millions-to-u\ns-and-new-mexico-to-remedy-pollution-concerns.

      "essay": "Hello friend, \nI hope that everything is well with you! I recently learned something interesting in my Introduction to Economics class, and I thought you would be interested in hearing more about it. Recently we have been discussing this idea of market failure and how we are able to see it in the real-world. In general, it is important to understand market failure to see how markets can sometimes fall short in efficiently allocating resources. \nTo put it in simpler terms, market failure happens when the allocation of goods in a free market is not efficient, then resulting in a misallocation of resources. There are many reasons why this can happen and there are also many different types of market failures including, externalities, common resources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods. \nA great example of a type of market failure is one I found in a recent article published in The New York Times titled, “Can Europe Save Forests Without Killing Jobs in Malaysia?\" The article mainly discusses the ongoing conflict between environmental conservation efforts and economic interests, with a focus on the palm oil industry in Malaysia. \nIn this particular case, the market failure is defined as a negative externality associated with palm oil production. An externality is a misallocation of resources leading to market failure, but a negative externality is when one party makes conditions worse for a third party not associated with the original party. In simpler terms, it is when one party has to suffer an indirect cost for the actions of another party. In this case, The article states, \"Palm oil production leads to deforestation, habitat destruction, and environmental degradation, imposing costs on society that are not reflected in the market price of palm oil.” (Cohen) These environmental impacts are external to the market transaction between producers and consumers of palm oil, leading to overproduction and overconsumption relative to what would be socially optimal. \nOn top of all of that, the European Union’s ban on imports linked with deforestation increases this market’s failure. The use of the ban is to protect forests and combat climate change, but it also challenges the communities of small farmers in Southeast Asia, since they have a heavy reliance on the palm oil industry for income. As stated, “The ban restricts the market for palm oil produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, affecting small farmers who depend on palm oil for their livelihoods.\" (Cohen) \nOverall, this article illustrates a market failure driven by negative externalities in the palm oil industry. It showcases the complex ethical and economical trade-offs involved in considering environmental issues. I hope this helps you understand the basics of market failure, and how it applies in the real-world.

      "essay": "Subject: Market Failure Clarification – Econ 101\nHello [Friend’s name]\nI hope all is well for you despite the unexpected circumstances. I understand that market\nfailure can be a confusing concept, so I’ll do my best to clarify it alongside using a recent news\narticle as an example. The term market failure described by Dudley “occurs when the market on\nits own fails to be efficient with no outside or government intervention” (Dudley). The market\nfails to be efficient because it fails to maximize total surplus due to a misallocation of resources.\nMarket failures that we have learned in class so far are externalities, common resources, public\ngoods, and artificially scarce goods. I will explore externalities using an example where the\nactions of producers or consumers have consequences for third parties not involved in the\nmarket.\nThere are two types of externalities: negative and positive. A negative externality results\nin an external cost due to an individual or firm imposing an uncompensated cost on others\n(Dudley). In a market with a negative externality, the market equilibrium results in too many\nunits of the good compared to the efficient level (Dudley). However, for positive externalities,\nthe same reasons instead cause an external benefit, and market equilibrium results in fewer units\nof the good compared to the efficient level. The efficient level would be the optimal quantity that\nmaximizes total surplus, but since it is at market equilibrium, the market fails to be efficient,\ntherefore a market failure occurs.\nTo clearly illustrate the concept, I will go into an example of a real-world example of a\nmarket failure. In the article, Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns, it discusses\nhow the issue of microplastic pollution is becoming a bigger issue due to the increase in plastic\nwaste, as it is affecting various environments and the human body. The article addresses how\nmicroplastics in recent studies pose potential health risks, such as an increased likelihood of\nheart attacks and strokes associated with microplastics in the cardiovascular system. The market\nfailure in this article would be the production and consumption of plastics. This would be a\nnegative externality, as the environmental and health costs of microplastic pollution impose\nexternal costs on third parties not reflected in the market. Furthermore, it is a negative externality\nas the article addresses “very little of it has been recycled” and “microplastics are everywhere”\n(Jacobs). The market fails to recognize the external costs of microplastics, leading to\noverconsumption and market equilibrium not being at the socially efficient level. To address this\nmarket failure, the government can intervene. They can impose taxes or regulations on plastic\nproduction to “internalize the external costs” of pollution and ultimately reduce plastic use to the\noptimal efficient quantity (Dudley). This may be challenging due to the scale of the issue, but if\nthe transaction costs of making a deal are low the economy can reach the optimal quantity.\nHopefully this gives you a better understanding and if you have any questions or need\nclarification, feel free to let me know.\nBest regards,\n*******\nWord Count [499]\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Consumer and Producer Surplus.” 2024, Economics 101, Department of\nEconomics, University of Michigan.

      "essay": "Hello,\nI hope this email finds you well. I understand you're finding the concept of market failure a bit\nelusive, so let’s go over the topic with some clear examples, followed by an interesting case from\na recent Wall Street Journal article on AI technology.\nMarket failure occurs when the invisible hand of the free market doesn’t lead to the best\noutcomes for society as a whole. It’s a bit like a group project where, without clear roles, some\nwork too hard while others don't contribute their fair share, resulting in a less than ideal outcome.\nIn economic terms, it can happen in a few different ways:\n● Externalities: These are indirect costs or benefits that affect bystanders. For instance, a\nfactory might pollute a river that local communities rely on, imposing health and\nenvironmental costs not accounted for in the product’s price.\n● Public Goods: These are goods that everyone can use freely, like public parks. Since no\none is excluded from using them, the market can struggle to supply them without\ngovernment support.\n● Common Resources: Similar to public goods but with the added risk of overuse, such as\nfishing grounds. They're available to all, leading to depletion as each person takes more\nthan their sustainable share.\nNow, let’s consider the article, \"AI Is Ravenous for Energy. Can It Be Satisfied?\" It perfectly\nillustrates a market failure in the form of negative externalities. The situation is this: AI\ntechnologies require large amounts of electricity, which contributes to global energy demand\npressures and potential environmental damage. These effects are not reflected in the cost of AI\nproducts and services, which means the price doesn't include the true societal cost, in this case,\nthe environmental impact.\nThe article emphasizes a projection that AI's energy demands may soon require a surge in global\nelectricity, comparable to adding a new country’s worth of power needs. Despite this, the prices\nfor AI do not consider the extensive energy required to cool down AI chips or the associated\ncarbon footprint. This mismatch between the market price and the social cost of AI energy\nconsumption leads to more AI usage than is socially optimal, which is a classic negative\nexternality.\nIn the grand scheme, AI is pushing up the demand for electricity but isn’t paying for its\nenvironmental toll, which could mean more pollution, higher greenhouse gas emissions, and\naccelerated climate change. This is where government intervention could help, potentially\nthrough taxes on energy consumption or regulations that mandate more energy-efficient tech.\nI hope this helps clarify market failures for you, using AI’s energy consumption as a real-world\nexample.\nTake care,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 435\nArticle:\nMims, Chistopher. “Ai Is Ravenous for Energy.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope all is well. I am responding to your inquiries about market failure in the hope that I\ncan better explain the concept to you while you are away. On a general level, market failure\noccurs when the market fails to be efficient on its own. This is not always the market equilibrium\nprice, however. The market is efficient if the quantity and price are at points that maximize total\nsurplus (Dudley).\nOne recent article from The New York Times that helps to explain this market activity is\n“Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns” by Andrew Jacobs. This article discusses\none specific market failure prevalent in today’s society: pollution. The article specifically talks\nabout plastic pollution as a growing problem in addition to microplastics and was released to\ncoincide with the release of a film entitled Plastic People. Microplastics are becoming more and\nmore present in society in a number of dangerous ways, even showing up in the human body.\nThe particular market failure of pollution falls under the category of an externality,\nspecifically being a negative externality. A negative externality is “a side effect that imposes\ncosts on others” (Krugman). This is essentially saying that a negative externality is a cost that a\nthird party faces the brunt of, when the third party was not involved in the transaction or event\ntaking place.\nPlastic pollution is defined as a negative externality because it places a cost on people not\ninvolved in any form of transaction. The buying and selling of plastic by consumers and\nproducers respectively has a negative impact on people not taking part in this exchange. This is\nbecause plastic ends up breaking down in places like oceans, eventually working its way into\nanimals. This has the potential to end up in humans and cause a variety of costly health problems\nor could cause people to pay to clean the oceans. The quantity of plastic would have to be lower\nthan the equilibrium quantity to account for the cost lost by people impacted by this type of\npollution. This would bring the market down to a place in which total surplus is maximized.\nWith externalities, the government can intervene either with the specific good or service\nbeing provided, in this case plastic, or with the externality itself, plastic pollution. In this\ninstance, the government could focus on the externality by specifying actions the consumers and\nproducers are limited to, or they could focus on plastic and put technological requirements in\nplace in relation to its production or consumption. It could also put taxes into effect in relation to\nthe externality or the good, or it could enforce permits or production quotas.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope you're feeling okay due to the sudden family emergency. I wanted to keep you up\nto date with our Economics class, and we are currently going over market failures now. A market\nfailure in economics refers to a situation where the allocation of goods and services by a free\nmarket is not efficient, often leading to net social welfare loss. Market failures can occur for\nvarious reasons, and when they do, they provide a reason for government intervention to correct\nthese inefficiencies. One type of market failure that occurs is called a Public Good. Public goods\nare non-exculade and non-rivalrous, meaning no one can be excluded from their use, and one\nperson’s use does not reduce its availability for others. Because it is difficult to change for their\nuse, the market usually under producers these goods. Another type of market failure is a common\nresource market failure where there are resources that are non-excludable but rivalrous, meaning\nthey are not available for everyone to use but can get used up by overuse. When everyone tries to\nget the most out of a shared resource without thinking of the long term consequences there can\nbe problems such as overuse and depletion of the good. Next, there is an artificially scarce good,\nwhere a product or service is made less available than it naturally could be. The main effect of\ncreating artificially scarce goods is that it messes up the balance between supply and demand,\nwhich can lead to problems such as higher prices. Lastly, there are externalities, where the\nproduction or consumption of a good or service imposes costs or benefits on a third party not\ndirectly involved in the transaction. There are positive and negative externalities; negative\nexternalities result in the overproduction of a good while positive externalities can lead to\nunderproduction. According to the Washington Post, a vessel containing oil was reportedly\noverturned off the coast of Tobago. As the spill blackened beaches, a key draw for the country’s\nimportant tourism sector, Prime Minister Kieth Rowley has declared a national emergency. They\nstate if the oil spill had been farther north or west, the spill could have rounded the tip of Tobago\nat Crown Point and contaminated the island’s west coast, home to several resorts and tourist\nattractions. The article goes into the concerns about the country’s environment and tourism that\ncould potentially arise due to the oil spill. The market failure in this situation would be pollution,\nspecifically to the water and soil, which is considered a negative externality. This example\nspecifically, the company that owns the oil or vessel does not bear the costs associated with the\ncleanup, environmental restoration, or the other broader impacts from the spill. Since the market\nfails to account for the true cost of oil production and transportation in this example, it is\nconsidered a market failure and it will require government intervention such as regulations and\nfines to help correct this imbalance in the market.\n(496)\nWork Cited\nKarklis, Laris. “Oil Spill off Trinidad and Tobago Blackens Caribbean Beaches - ...” The Washington\nPost, 14 Feb. 2024, www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/14/trinidad-tobago-oil-spill/.",

      "essay": "1\nTo: Friend\nFrom: Y our Friend\nDate: March 26, 2024\nDear Friend:\nI understand market failure may be difficult to grasp at first. The article from The\nWashington Post’s Dino Grandoni, “How air pollution prevents pollinators from finding their\nflowers,” will help us explain market failures.\nThe article discusses how air pollution impairs pollinators, such as moths, from locating\nflowers due to the diminishing scent cues necessary for pollination, which can affect the\nreproduction of plants humans rely on. Researchers have identified that pollutants, mainly from\nNO3, formed from emissions of cars and other industrial sources, degrade certain scent chemicals\nattractive to pollinators, resulting in a significant decrease in moth visitation to flowers.\nMarket failure occurs when a free market allocates goods and services inefficiently. The\narticle explains a type of market failure known as an externality, specifically a negative\nexternality, where the costs of air pollution impact entities not directly involved in the production\nor consumption of the goods causing the pollution (Krugman 123). In this case, the cost is on the\npollinators and the plants, not the industries or individuals emitting the pollutants. The market’s\ninability to account for the indirect cost of air pollution on pollination and ecosystems leads to a\nsuboptimal allocation of resources and potential long-term detriment to biodiversity and\nagriculture. While the firms responsible for the emissions incur some of the costs of polluting,\nsuch as fuel or maintenance, they do not bear the full social costs, known as the external costs,\nthat their actions impose on the environment and agriculture.\n2\nMarket equilibrium is achieved when supply equals demand at a specific price point,\nassuming all costs and benefits are accounted for. With externalities, like air pollution, true costs,\nknown as external marginal costs, are not included. Therefore, the market price does not reflect\nthe true cost to society, rendering the market equilibrium inefficient. Pursuing efficiency, such as\nwith the Coase Theorem, suggests that if the affected parties can negotiate without costs, they\ncould reach an agreement that mitigates the externality without government intervention\n(Dudley). If the pollinators were humans, they could negotiate with polluters to reduce\nemissions. However, government intervention is often necessary due to the impracticality of the\nnegotiations, especially those involving non-human parties, and society’s welfare (Krugman 16).\nThere are several government interventions to correct market failure. Standards impose\nlimits on the amount of pollutants firms can emit. Taxes on emissions, a Pigovian tax, make it\nmore expensive to pollute and create an incentive to reduce emissions (Dudley). Quotas cap the\ntotal amount of permissible pollution, and tradable emission permits create a market for pollution\nallowances, providing a profit motive for companies to produce less pollution than they are\nallowed (Krugman 147). If governments tax NO3 emissions, the polluters would face higher\ncosts, forcing them to find ways to reduce their pollution. Tradable NO3 permits could lead\ncompanies to reduce emissions cheaply to be able to sell permits to others (Dudley).\nI hope my explanation of market failure in the case of pollution helps you better\nunderstand market failure.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\n3\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities, Ch. 16, Lecture.” Accessed 23 March 2024.\nGrandoni, Dino. “How air pollution prevents pollinators from finding their flowers.” The\nWashington Post, 8 February 2024,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/08/air-pollution-pollinato\nr-moths/.

Last night,\nI was browsing through the internet before I went to sleep and came across this interesting article\nfrom the New Y ork Times which spoke about the housing affordability market crisis. I know you\nare in the process of looking for a new house to live in for school next year, so I figured I would\nshare this article with you that may inform you about the current housing market problems. Y ou\nmay be thinking to yourself, “what is market failure?” By definition, according to\ninvestopidia.com market failure “is the economic situation defined by an inefficient distribution\nof goods and services in the free market. Furthermore, the individual incentives for rational\nbehavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group.” In 2021 after the Covid pandemic, the\nvacancy rate of housing in your city of New Y ork was 4.5% which is considered low. However,\nin 2023 vacancy ratings dropped to 1.4%. According to the New Y ork Times, a healthy vacancy\nrating is considered to be between 5-8%. The reason this could be considered a market failure is\nbecause there are insufficient turnovers making New Y ork accessible because the demand for\nhousing significantly exceeds the supply. Mayor Adams states that “The data is clear: The\ndemand to live in our city is far outpacing our ability to build housing.” Not only does this have\nan adverse effect on the housing market, but this also could affect the flow of the whole\neconomy. As a result of the scarcity of housing in the city, prices of the homes will increase due\nto being so limited. Because of this, working class and lower class blue collar citizens are forced\nto move out of the city due to these high prices. This can lead to a crash in the entire economy as\na result, because there is more of a demand for laborers that are needed in the community such as\nconstruction workers and employees who are a necessity to functioning societies. So luke, I just\nwant to inform you about the housing market failures as you continue on your journey to find a\nnew place to live for this upcoming school year. I think it is crucial that you understand the\neffects of the housing market failure especially when it comes to making a financial decision like\nthis.

      "essay": "Hi Adam,\nI hope you’re doing well. About the market failure you asked to me yesterday, I’ll give a clearer\nexplanation via this email. Market failure occurs when the market fails to reach an efficient\noutcome. This inefficiency leads to the total surplus not being maximized, even if the market is\nin its equilibrium. Therefore, society experiences an inefficient net gain, leading to\nuncompensated deadweight loss when comparing the total surplus at equilibrium with the\nefficient outcome of the market.\nI found an article in the Wall Street Journal discussing how bitcoin mining used more water than\nNew York City last year (click to review). Try skimming through this article; it will help you\nunderstand what I’m about to explain better. The article highlighted the extreme water usage by\nBitcoin miners, where they used billions of gallons of water globally (Niiler Eric WSJ 2024).\nThis has raised significant environmental concerns, particularly regarding water scarcity\nproblems, especially in drought-prone areas (Niiler Eric WSJ 2024). From these two\nobservations, we can conclude that this is a type of negative externality that might lead to market\nfailure.\nFirst, we have to understand that water is considered as a common resource, meaning it’s\nnon-excludable (people cannot be prevented from accessing it) and rivals in consumption(one\nperson’s consumption of water reduces others’ ability to enjoy it) (McClung, Sean, 2023). Water\nis considered a necessity for the general public. Nonetheless, this unnecessary demand and\nconsumption of water for activities like running the computers and air conditioning (Niiler Eric\nWSJ 2024) during Bitcoin mining only benefits the businesses involved and not the general\npublic. This leads to negative externality, as the third party that is not involved in the Bitcoin\nbusiness (the public) bear the cost of facing water shortages.\nSince Bitcoin businesses do not consider the social marginal cost and their impact on the general\npublic, mining quantities exceed the efficient quantity which causes a reduction in total surplus\nin the market, leading to a deadweight loss. If the social marginal cost is taken into account, the\ncost of mining would increase, thus reducing the incentive for water-intensive activities.\nHowever, since the costs are not fully internalized by the miners, this will be considered as\nmarket failure as the market price of bitcoin does not reflect the true cost of mining, which\nsupposedly includes the social marginal cost (GPT-4 turbo).\nTo mitigate this matter, the government could intervene by imposing a tax equivalent to the cost\nof negative externalities (Pigovian tax). Plus, the government could also set a water usage\nrestrictions policy for mining, thereby limiting the usage of water for this activity, thus reducing\nthe social marginal cost and allowing the general public to enjoy the goods (water).\nI hope this email clarifies your confusion regarding market failure.

      "essay": "Dear Econ Classmate, \nI am emailing you because I know that you have been absent and have missed the content on market failure. I will be explaining the concepts to you and how they can be shown in a real-world example to help you understand what a market failure is. Before explaining the types of market failure, you should know that market failure occurs when the market fails to be efficient.\nThe different types of market failure are Negative Externalities, Positive Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, Private Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. Negative Externalities occur when a transaction between a consumer and producer affects a third party negatively. Positive Externalities occur when a third party is being affected positively. The following will be Types of Goods, which deal with being excludable, non-excludable, rival in consumption, or not rival. Excludable means that it will cost the consumer a price to consume and rival in consumption means that more than one person cannot consume at the same time. If a good is non-excludable, this means that the supplier can face a free-rider problem, meaning that many consumers will avoid paying to consume it. A good can be a non-rival when there is no change in the marginal cost of the producer to give another person access to it. For example, a Common Resource is excludable and rival in consumption. A Public Good is non-excludable and it is a non-rival in consumption. An example of a Private Good is excludable and is rival in consumption, so only one person can consume the good at a time. Lastly, Artificially Scarce Good is when there is a cost to consume the good and it is non-rival in consumption. \nI would like to focus on Artificially Scarce Goods, so you understand the concept further. When I was browsing through the Wall Street Journal, I found an example of it through this article is: www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/weight-loss-drugs-employer-insurance-dbe19458?mod=health_feat3_healthcare_pos3. It discusses how employers have restricted their employees from being prescribed weight-loss drugs because it is costly on their end. The article focused on Jason Krynicki because he had to start paying for his weight loss pills which were previously paid for by his employer. This means that the pills are excludable because employers now must pay to consume them. It is non-rival in consumption because the marginal cost should be $0 to give someone else access to pills. This means that the market states consumers should be given free access. However, this cannot happen because companies would not continue generating revenue to continue producing and remain in the market. For this reason, it is failing to be efficient. \nI hope this helped your understanding of the market failures that exist in Econ 101. You can send me an email if you do not understand a certain concept or want me to explain further. \n\nBest,\nEcon Classmate\n\n\n\nWord Count: 475\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \nCalfas, Jennifer. “Patients Lose Access to Weight-Loss Drugs as Employers Stop Coverage .” The Wall Street Journal, 5 Mar. 2024, www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/weight-loss-drugs-employer-insurance-dbe19458?mod=health_feat3_healthcare_pos3.

      "essay": "March 22nd, 2023\nHey Friend!\nI found a New Y ork Times article that I think will help you to better understand Market Failure\nthat we've been learning in Econ 101. Here's the link and citation for it:\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New Y ork Times,\nThe New Y ork Times, 9 Mar. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html.\nBeginning with Market Failure, which is an economic scenario when goods or services are not\nallocated efficiently without any intervention in a free market. This means that while trading a\ncertain price may be a great and rational choice for one party (like the producers), trading at that\nprice is not the sensicle choice for the rest of those involved in the market (like consumers). This\ncould maximize the original group's surplus, but the societal marginal cost or the loss of surplus\nfrom the other side of the market will outweigh that group's increase. The market is not being as\nefficient as it could possibly be as it is not maximizing total surplus for all parties involved since\nsome feel adverse effects.\nThis article discusses microplastics, which are remnants of broken down plastic goods that have\nended up all over the world in natural parks, oceans, on mountains, and even inside human\nbodies. This massive form of pollution, while the goods it comes from are infinitely useful, is\ncreating a big problem for the environment and humanity. This means that Microplastics are a\nnegative externality of plastic good consumption. A negative externality is an uncompensated\ncost that an individual or group imposes on others, and because no company that produces or\nsells plastic is reimbursing the people or places affected for the damage, microplastic pollution\nqualifies. The negative externalities cause market failure because one group is making another\ngroup (those dealing with pollution) in the market worse off, and not bearing any consequences\nor costs from it, and therefore not maximizing total surplus or society's marginal being. To help\nwith the cost of pollution to society, the government could place a production quota or an\nemission based Pigouvian tax.\nSo to summarize all of this for you, a market failure is when the market fails to reach the\nefficient quantity (maximum total surplus) absent any interventions. A negative externality like\nmicroplastic pollution is an example of this because companies that sell plastic goods are not\ncompensating the people that are negatively affected by the pollution, and so total surplus is not\nmaximized and the market fails to be efficient.\nHope this was helpful, let me know if you have more questions.

Y ou're in luck because I found a\nfascinating article illustrating this through the protein transition in high-income countries.\nIn economic terms, market failure occurs when a free market allocates goods and services\ninefficiently, resulting in a net societal welfare loss or deadweight loss. Externalities, common\nresources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods are all prime examples. These scenarios can\nsometimes be solved or improved through government intervention to address the inefficiencies.\nThe article, published in \"Nature Food,\" discusses the current trend of rebalancing protein\nintake by reducing reliance on animal proteins in favor of plant-based and alternative proteins.\nThis transition can improve a number of problems, including environmental degradation, health\nconcerns, and ethical concerns about animal cruelty, all exacerbated by the overproduction and\nconsumption of animal proteins.\nOne key aspect of market failure highlighted here is externalities. The production and\nconsumption of animal proteins have a major environmental impact, imposing negative\nexternalities such as greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen cycle disruption.\nThese external costs are not factored into the market price of animal proteins, resulting in\noverconsumption and excess production. This disparity demonstrates a clear case of market\nfailure, as the monetary cost of producing animal protein is less than the true societal cost. The\nsales price of meat, chicken, pork or other proteins does not reflect all of the costs incurred by\nsociety.\nThe article also discusses common resources and public goods in the context of\nenvironmental impacts and ethical concerns about industrial livestock production. The overuse of\ncommon resources such as water and land for livestock production exemplifies another aspect of\nmarket failure: a lack of clear ownership leads to overexploitation and degradation of these\nresources. If all of the costs, such as the cost of the water that the livestock drinks, were included\nin the price, demand for the animal protein would be reduced. Alternatively, if the producer\nabsorbed the cost, they would likely supply less to the market. Either way, the current quantity\nsold is higher than it should be if all costs were considered.\nIn addressing these issues, the article discusses various narratives and solutions, including\nconsumer-driven dietary shifts, technological innovations in protein production, and systemic\nchanges to the agri-food system. These solutions aim to internalize the external costs associated\nwith animal protein production and consumption, thus correcting the market failure.\nThis example demonstrates how externalities, common resources, and public goods\nintersect with the concept of market failure. It emphasizes the complexities of these challenges\nand the various approaches required to overcome them. Understanding the protein transition\nreveals the essential role of economic principles in addressing some of the most critical societal\nand environmental issues.\nI hope this helps clarify the concept of market failure. Let me know if you have any\nremaining questions. I look forward to having you back in class soon.\nBest,\n[Y our Classmate and Friend]",

      "essay": "Subject: Exploring Market Failure through the Lens of Microplastics\nDear fellow economics student,\nMarket failure arises when the market's distribution of goods is inefficient, causing a decrease in\noverall economic well-being. When the drivers of supply and demand don't maximize efficiency,\nthe results lead to a mismatch where either an excess or deficit of a product occurs. This type of\nfailure usually happens when private interests are misaligned with the collective well-being of\nsociety and is often the result of externalities – unfavorable costs or favorable benefits that\nimpact third parties (those not part of the transaction).\nIn the article, “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns,” Jacobs highlights how\nmicroplastics are polluting the environment, entering human bodies, and linked to several human\nhealth problems – a direct example of a negative externality. Microplastics have been found not\nonly between the peaks of mountains and ocean sea floors, but alarmingly in human bodies: in\nthe lungs, blood, placenta, brain, and even in breast milk. A study published in the New England\nJournal of Medicine, conducted on 312 participants, revealed microplastics within human blood\nvessel walls. These individuals were 4.5 times more likely to suffer from heart attacks, strokes,\nand death (Paolisso, 2024). Even more, microplastics have been linked to brain cancer,\ninflammatory bowel disease, and higher risks for complications after a heart attack or stroke. If\nlodged in the cardiovascular system, immune cells die three times faster (Vrisekoop, 2023).\nHazardous materials such as polystyrene (commonly found in packaging materials) and nylon (a\nprevalent microplastic) harm the development of the lungs and can result in fatality (Melgert,\n2023).\nThis is a market failure via a negative externality with implications for human well-being and\nhealth. The harm caused by plastics to ecosystems and human health is not factored into the\neconomic equation when transactions occur. In an inefficient framework where producers and\nconsumers engage in a transaction, such as the production and consumption of plastics, neither\nparty chooses to take on the economic burden of the externalized effects/costs of a plastic life.\nThe true cost of plastic is not reflected in its market price, leading to overuse and excessive\nproduction of plastic goods. Since there are health and environmental dangers that negatively\naffect the health of other individuals, unseen by the individual choosing to buy or sell the plastic\nproduct, market failure is a negative externality.\nWhen there are market failures, governments step in to correct those failures. Subsidizing\nalternatives, incidentally, is a perfect approach. An example of subsidization to reduce plastic\nusage may include promoting biodegradable materials through tax credits. Offering tax credits to\ncompanies makes it cheaper for businesses to convert to these alternatives, encouraging a\ntransition from plastic usage to more eco-friendly materials.\nWarm regards,\nA classmate\nWord count: 451 words\nArticle URL: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-\npeople.html?searchResultPosition=2\nWorks Cited\n“Dr. Nienke Vrisekoop – UMCU.” Momentum,\nmomentummicroplastics.nl/about-us/participants/nienke-vrisekoop.\nJacobs, A.

Total surplus considers everyone in society who is\naffected by that market, which may include consumers, producers, and third parties. Market\nequilibrium may not maximize total surplus for various reasons, such as externalities (Dudley\n“Consumer and Producer”).\nExternalities occur when producers and consumers make decisions in goods and services\nmarkets that affect individuals who are not directly involved. Since the people affected by\ndecision-makers had nothing to do with the decisions in the market, they are a third party.\nExternalities can be positive or negative, and they differ in their effect on the third party. Positive\nexternalities are unexpected benefits that a third party receives due to producers and consumers\nin a market. Market failure occurs because the market fails to compensate for these external\nbenefits; therefore, the market underproduces because market equilibrium is less than the\nefficient level, and total surplus is not maximized. By contrast, negative externalities are\nuncompensated costs that producers and consumers in a market impose on a third party. Market\nfailure occurs because the market fails to compensate for these external costs; therefore, the\nmarket overproduces because market equilibrium is greater than the efficient level, and total\nsurplus is not maximized. In both cases, the price of the external benefit or cost is not reflected in\nTariq 2\nthe market equilibrium price of that good or service because the market fails to account for\nexternality, creating deadweight loss because the market does not generate as much total surplus\nas possible (Dudley “Externalities”)\nAn excellent example of a market failure through an externality is highlighted by a\nWashington Post discussing a study from the V eterinary Journal that followed 120 Scottish\nterriers over three years. The study aimed to understand the connection between exposure to\ncigarette smoke and bladder cancer in these dogs. The findings revealed that Scottish terriers\nliving in homes with smokers were six times more likely to develop bladder cancer compared to\nthose in nonsmoking homes. This situation exemplifies a market failure known as a negative\nexternality as the actions of one party, smokers, impose costs on another party, their pets, who\nare not part of the transaction. Secondhand smoke, in this case, exposes dogs to harmful\nchemicals, leading to an increased risk of bladder cancer (Blakemore).\nThe article deliberates the implications of actions like secondhand smoke and its adverse\neffects, shedding light on the importance of recognizing market failures. I hope you now\nunderstand the principles of market failure and its examples in daily life.

I am emailing you to clarify the concept of market failures and any content we have covered in lecture. A market failure occurs when a market fails to be efficient as a result of several factors. This is measured by comparing the market outcome to the efficient outcome. When a market is inefficient there are missed opportunities, where some people could be made better off without making other people worse off. When defining efficiency, it is important to consider that it means maximizing total surplus, which is society’s total net gain. From previous marginal analysis, we know that we maximize total net gain where marginal benefit intersects marginal cost. The three main reasons a market is inefficient is due to market power, externalities, and the nature of a good making it unsuitable for efficient location by a market. (Krugman, 2020)\nMoreover, markets can fail due to externalities which occur when actions of others have side effects on the welfare of others. Negative externalities are an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others which is also known as an external cost. A key example of this is pollution which is exemplified by an article from the New York Times regarding the Biden administration. Their recent decision to impose limits on fine industrial particles would approximately prevent 4,500 premature deaths as a result of industrial pollution. (Friedman, 2024) The market failure discussed in this article is the externality caused by air pollution, where the polluter does not consider the indirect costs to those harmed by the pollution as this air pollution acts as an external cost. More specifically, the type of market failure is due to the role of negative externalities which leads to adverse health impacts and pollution for the environment which are not taken into account by producers such as factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities when making decisions. Individuals and communities affected by this air pollution face consequences such as healthcare costs and reduced quality of life. Moreover, the EPA’s decision to toughen the limits of pollution represents an example to address this market failure. By setting more limits on these pollution levels the government is aiming to internalize the external costs of pollution and promote a more efficient allocation of resources. \n\nSincerely,\nX\n\nWord Count - 391\n\nWorks Cited\n-\tFriedman, Lisa. “Biden Administration Toughens Limits on Deadly Air Pollution.” The New York Times, 7 February 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/climate/epa-air-pollution-soot.html?searchResultPosition=2.

      "essay": "Econ 101 WA3\nDr. Dudley\n3/25/2024\nDear Friend,\nWe discovered in class that market efficiency is the point at which supply and demand\nmeet at a price and quantity that are equilibrium. This is a fundamental concept of economics\nand economists assess changes in efficiency to comprehend the nature of the market.\nI heard you are having trouble understanding what market failure is. I located a news\nstory about an oil spill in Trinidad and Tobago to help clarify things for you. When products and\nservices in a market fall short of an efficient result, without government intervention in the form\nof price ceilings or tax breaks, this is known as market failure. Broadly speaking, externalities,\nshared resources, public goods, and artificial scarcity of resources within a market can all lead to\nmarket failures. The market failure that resulted from negative externalities and shared resources\ncan be explained by the oil crisis in Tobago. Negative externalities are costs that a company can\nunintentionally impose on others. In the article, an oil spill in the Caribbean, caused an oil leak\non a Caribbean beach, leading to an environmental crisis. This boat contained 500 gallons of oil\nwhich was released into the ocean and onto its treasured beaches. The exact damages are yet to\nbe fully understood.\nThe company responsible for the ship that spilled did not take sufficient preventative\nmeasures, therefore the market has failed to consider the negative externalities of their actions,\nand society is bearing the cost of these actions. The social marginal costs (SMC) in the case of\nthe Trinidad and Tobago crisis, refer to the health and environmental costs of evacuation and\ncontamination forced upon the tourist town of Tobago. Private marginal cost (PMC) refers to the\ncosts paid by the producer, which in this case would only include cleanup costs from the accident\nand legal liabilities.\nEcon 101 WA3\nDr. Dudley\n3/25/2024\nThe Tobago spill is a market failure due to negative externalities. The actions of a\ncompany to produce, transport, and then spill the oil affect the health of an entire community.\nThis crisis also highlights the issue of common resources creating market failure. In the short\nterm, everyone had to evacuate the beaches, leaving the local economy out to dry without\ntourism. In the long run, oil could permanently ruin the animal ecosystem of Tobago and hinder\nclean drinking water. Not to mention the unbelievably high costs of cleaning oil spills.\nThere has been an inefficient use of resources as a result of the problem with locals and\nvisitors not being able to use the contaminated beaches and possibly drinking contaminated\nwater. The Tobago community was impacted by inefficient resource allocation and negative\nexternalities, which could have been avoided if the market had taken into account the price of\nmoving the oil more safely.\nInefficiency and market failure arise when the market is unable to generate an ideal\ndistribution of goods and services to satisfy consumer needs. The effects can be enormous as in\nTobago, a major environmental and health crisis was brought on by market failure.\nI hope this helps, see you soon, friend,\nSimon Olson\nWord Count:499\nReferences\nLaris Karklis.\n“Caribbean oil spill blackens beaches, but mystery apparently cleared up” The\nWashington Post, The Washington Post, 14 Feb. 2024,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/14/trinidad-tobago-oil-spill/",

      "essay": "Hey Friend,\nMarket failure is definitely a tough subject, so I am here to help. Market failure\nencompasses the idea that a market is failing when it is inefficient on its own – ie. the\ngovernment is not involved. In other words, the market is not maximizing its total surplus. Some\nexamples of market failure are externalities, market power, and types of goods.\nTypes of goods consist of four categories based on excludability, and if they are rivals in\nconsumption or not. Excludable means that in order to access a good you must pay for it. A\nnonexcludable good is one that can be accessed for free. A rival good is one that cannot be used\nwhile others are using it – for instance your phone – nobody can use your phone while you are. A\nnonrival good is one that anyone can use simultaneously. For example the Oscars, anyone can\nwatch simultaneously. Using these two traits, goods are separated into 4 categories; private\ngoods (excludable and rival), artificially scarce goods (excludable and nonrival), common\nresources (nonexcludable and rival), and public goods (nonexcludable and nonrival).\nMarket power occurs when a market is not perfectly competitive and there exists an\ninfluence on a price to be higher or lower than equilibrium. A monopoly is an example of market\npower.\nLast, externalities are when a third party not directly involved in the market is affected. A\npositive externality is one that benefits those not involved in a market. Flu shots are an example\nof this. When people get flu shots their intention is to not get the flu, but it also lowers the chance\nof someone who is not vaccinated contracting the flu, which is a positive externality for those\nindividuals. When a positive externality exists, it influences the demand curve, causing it to shift\nto the right. There exists market failure because the demand of the vaccine decreases due to\nlower cases of the flu as a result of those who are vaccinated. This results in a demand for the\nvaccine being lower than the efficient number of recipients. A negative externality occurs when a\nparty imposes a cost/negative outcome on an uninvolved party. Here’s an example:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/climate/epa-soot-lawsuit.html?unlocked_article_code=1.b\n00.gmb0.OMS6pAkupMBe&smid=url-share\nThe article is about the government trying to lower the amount of particle emissions\nfactories can produce, which many states are suing over. Particle emissions are pollution, a\nnegative externality, because breathing them in causes problems like heart disease, asthma and\nlow birth weight(Friedman). In terms of a supply and demand graph. When a negative externality\nis present it shifts the supply curve leftwards. This shift causes marginal social cost to outweigh\nthe benefit - lowering the total surplus because the negative cost is having a greater effect than\nwhen equal at efficiency. This ordeal usually results in quotas dictating how much pollution can\nbe produced, licenses deciding who can produce, or in many cases, a tax on pollution.\nSee you soon.\nWord Count (498)\nBibliography\nFriedman, Lisa. \"Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A.

      "essay": "To: Jane Smith\nToday I will be discussing the topic of market failure. Put simply, market failure is when goods\nor services are distributed inefficiently in a particular economic situation (Ross). There are three\nmain ways in which markets are inefficient: market power, externalities, common resources,\npublic goods, and artificially scarce goods. Market power is when a firm or corporation has the\nability to raise the market price (Ribaudo). Externalities is when actions which are unrelated to\nthe market at hand have a side effect on the welfare of others. Public goods, common resources,\nand private information is related to market failure as the nature of a particular good can make it\nunsuitable for efficient allocation by the market (Ross).\nTo explain how exactly market failure works, I have attached an article which demonstrates how\nmarket failure works. To sum up the article, the housing market is at an all-time low; individuals\ndo not want to sell their homes and as a result there is not enough homes being sold to match the\ncurrent demand for housing.\nThe article demonstrates how externalities potentially lead to market failure. Consumers such as\nGriffin and Jessica Fisher are affected by a negative externality. The increase in rent is a result of\na lower supply of housing (Friedman). This is a negative externality as a decrease in the supply\nof houses is indirectly affected by the current housing market conditions. Moreover, high\nmortgage rates, a limited supply of houses, and inflated prices create uncertainty which led to a\ndecrease in consumer’s confidence when entering and exiting the housing market (Friedman). On\nthe other hand, a positive externality exists for home builders. Because there is a shortage of\nhouses on the market, individuals who want to build houses are positively impacted as the high\ndemand for homes will raise the prices for the houses being built. However, this also negatively\naffects consumers as a limited supply of houses and high demand for houses increases home\nprices.\nWhile the housing market usually deals with private goods, the decrease in the supply for\nhousing can indirectly be related to limited land which is considered a common resource\n(Helbling). This is because as more housing developments are built, there is less land available.\nPublic good are nonrivals in consumption and non-excludable. The housing market is indirectly\nrelated to public goods as housing affordability and accessibility can be influenced by public\ngoods such as investments in goods such as roads and schools and government policies that help\nto provide affordable housing. If a home is in a better area, demand for homes increase while the\nopposite is true for an area with lower investment in public goods.\nThe described market failure can be attributed to many factors. Due to a decrease in the supply of\nhomes, mortgage rates rose and led to high prices and a limited number of choices for buyers.\nGoods in the housing market were inefficiently allocated as demand for houses was much higher\nthan the supply.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/home-sales-likely-fell-to-15-year-low-in-2023-\n3da220e1?mod=housing_more_article_pos27\nWord count: 498\nReferences\nFriedman, N.

      "essay": "To notecon@umich.edu\nMarket Failure on V acation\nHey,\nHope you’re having a fun vacation. I heard you’re failing to understand market failure, and I\nthought of an example that could help you understand. First of all, market failure is essentially\nwhen total surplus is not maximized due to an externality that isn’t accounted for. These\nexternalities can be both positive and negative externalities, despite it sounding like only\nnegative externalities are bad. To illustrate this, I have a short article for you to read. Here is the\nlink:https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-farmers-let-trucks-one-ukraine-border-crossin\ng-pass-pap-reports-2024-03-13/ I hope you read it, I promise it is not too long. In this scenario,\nthe Polish farmers blocking the road are the externality, with the market being the\nPolish-Ukrainian transportation market. The transportation market consists of common goods in\nthat they are non-excludable and rival goods. Non-excludable means that people are able to use\nthe good without having to pay for it. Drivers from one country do not pay taxes that support the\nroads in another country, and the Polish government allows Ukrainian drivers to use their roads\ndespite not paying for them. A rival good is a good whose consumption can prevent someone\nelse from using that same good. By using roads, drivers create traffic and congestion that can\nprevent or deter other drivers from using the road as well. The leader of the protest stated that\nthey had increased the number of trucks that they allowed across the border “to five per hour\nfrom one or two previously.” (Reuters) By limiting the rate of trucks crossing the border to five\nper hour, the farmers are imposing a massive social marginal cost, as they are preventing\nhundreds, or potentially thousands, of vehicles and people from crossing the border into Poland.\nThe social marginal cost is essentially the producer’s marginal cost plus the marginal cost of the\nexternality. Mathematically, this would be the Y -intercept of a slope-intercept linear equation.\nSpeaking in basic terms, this protest essentially puts a low quota on the number of cars allowed\nto cross the border, far below the efficient amount. In addition to causing the transportation\nmarket to experience failure, the protest additionally causes increased pollution, another form of\nsocial marginal cost due to blocking traffic. By forcing cars to idle without moving, they are\ncausing increased production of greenhouse gasses without any of the benefits that come with\ntheir production, which in this case is the ability to move great distances in a limited amount of\ntime. Hopefully this example helps you understand the meaning of a market failure so that you’ll\nbe able to crush the upcoming quizzes!\nIn good health,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 447\nSources:\nReuters. “Polish Farmers Backtrack on Fully Unblocking Ukraine Border Crossing, PAP\nReports.” Reuters, 13 Mar. 2024,\nwww.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-farmers-let-trucks-one-ukraine-border-crossing-pa\nss-pap-reports-2024-03-13/.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nAs you know, the intersection point where supply and demand are equal constitutes market equilibrium price and quantity where consumers and producers agree. What you may not know is that there are factors beyond this which may produce a market that is in equilibrium, but inefficient as total surplus is not maximized. To be concise, market failure occurs in a free market when resources are allocated inefficiently. To illuminate this concept of achieving the optimal quantity and price, I will centralize on one primary cause of market failure: externalities.\nExternalities a have a dual nature being as they can be positive or negative. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others (external Cost.) A positive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation (external benefit.) Common examples of positive externalities include education and vaccines. Frequent illustrations of negative externalities include noise pollution and smoking. A useful contemporary example of a negative externality comes from an article I read, produced by the New York Times.\nThe article covers the documented the pollution produced by some farms globally. Many farms choose their fertilizer’s based purely on the personal benefit of an increased crop yield. The often-unconsidered pollution from these fertilizers is the problem. The dispensing of these fertilizers contains particles released from emissions that can penetrate deep into our lungs, leading to heart and pulmonary diseases. The article goes as far as to state that at least 3.3 million deaths per year around the globe. In other words, while the farmers may be producing the same quantity of crops that consumers are demanding, the market still fails to be efficient due to the external cost of pollution. The actual total cost of farm production is not balanced out by the producer or consumer; instead, the burden simply falls on society at large. The societal cost of the pollution (health problems, death, etc.) is not reflected in the amount a consumer at the grocery store pays. Because this burden is costly in nature, this must be a negative externality leading to market failure. \nThinking graphivslly, the private marginal benefit of consumers in this situation does not change in this face of this externality. The private marginal cost of producers, however, does not include the societal cost of polluting the environment which must be considered in order to reach an efficient market.\n\n",

      "essay": "Hey friend I heard that you were having some trouble understanding the concept of market failures so I hope this email finds you well. As a baseline definition, a market failure happens when the market doesn’t maximize total surplus or in other words, reach an efficient outcome. This is at the point where the efficiency quantity and price doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing as equilibrium price and quantity. This lack of equality means that there is deadweight loss created before the government gets involved. \n\tThere are several types of market failures including public goods, artificially scarce goods, and common resources. A market failure occurs when there is an inefficient distribution of goods or services then ends in groups either getting too many or too little benefits. These market failures are categories based on the excludability (you have to pay to consume the good) and/or the rivalry in consumption (the same unit can’t be consumed by more than one person at a time) . Public goods are non-rival and non-excludable. Common resources are rival but non-excludable. Artificially scarce goods are excludable but non-rival. And the fourth category of goods, private goods, is both excludable and a rivalry in consumption, so it doesn’t constitute an immediate market failure. \n\tThe second type of market failures includes externalities, positive and negative. An externality refers to an indirect cost or benefit to a third party that occurs as an effect of another party’s activity. Positive externalities are a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation. Negative externalities are uncompensated costs individuals or firms impose on others. You might be wondering why is a positive externality a market failure, isn’t it a good thing? Well, even though it is a good thing, the equilibrium price and quantity don’t account for the external benefit, so they are underproducing or consuming. On a graph, the equilibrium price and quantity are lower than the efficient price, so total surplus isn’t maximized. To maximize total surplus, the price and quantity must be raised. \n\tA great example of a positive externality is the production of renewable power growth, such as wind and solar, and it is reaching new records. The external benefit of renewable power growth is that it offers a zero-carbon solution to our energy problem. “Growing renewable-energy generation is also helping to replace coal power, according to BMI, a Fitch Solutions research unit” (Khan). The market failure is that in equilibrium there is not enough clean energy. So, the government is backing firms in the form of grants/subsidies to increase quantity to an efficient one above the original market equilibrium. The market failure is a positive externality because the current equilibrium is not efficient, in other words more of it would be greatly needed. \nSincerely, \nYour friend\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nKhan, Yusuf. “U.S. Renewable Power Growth Is Setting New Records on the Back of Federal  Support.” Wall Street Journal , Dow Jones & Company Inc, 21 Feb. 2024, www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-renewable-power-growth-is-setting-new-records-on-the-back-of-federLink: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-renewable-power-growth-is-setting-new-records-on-the-back-of-federal-support-2f844b66 \n\n",

I am more than happy to explain the concept of what market failure is. To better understand the topic, I’m going to explain what a market failure is, the different types of market failure and an example of a market failure. A market failure occurs when there isn’t any intervention, including government intervention. The market fails to reach the efficient outcome, meaning that the market does not maximize total surplus. To measure the market's failure ,we first identify the total surplus at market equilibrium. Then, we identify the efficient outcome. Lastly, we measure the difference ( deadweight loss) between the gaps. The different types of market failures are. The most common market failures are externalities, common resources, and public goods. In class, we mainly focus on externalities.\n\nThere are two main externalities, which are positive and negative externalities. A positive externality is a benefit that individuals or firms confer on others without receiving compensation, which is also known as the External Benefit. A specific example we used in class was vaccines. If the majority of the population was to get vaccinated, it would limit the spread of people getting sick. On a graph we add our total external benefit plus marginal benefit to then get our social marginal benefit. Additionally, the social marginal benefit intersects with the marginal cost (supply curve) and which is where we get our efficient quantity. So since the social marginal benefit is higher than our marginal benefit, the government implements a subsidy so we can reach the efficient quantity. Switching gears, we have negative externalities. Negative Externalities is the uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Also known as the External Cost. Pollution, certain illnesses, and deforestation are examples of Negative Externalities. On the graph, we add our external cost plus our marginal cost to get the social marginal cost. Where the marginal benefit ( demand curve) intersects with social marginal cost is where we get the efficient quantity. Because negative externalities have negative impacts on society, the government implements a tax to reduce the number of buyers to get back to the market equilibrium. \n\nBy reading articles, we can identify what market failure is and what type of externalities are exhibited .From the Wall Street Journal, I chose an article about power lines sparking the largest wildfire in Texas history. According to the article it mentions, power lines started the smokehouse Creek Fire, which has destroyed dozens of homes. Additionally, some utilities are planning to shut down the power in areas that are deemed wildfire risk. Shutting down the power can affect water and transportation. By this brief description, we can see that this is a negative externality. It is a negative externality because wildfires affect resources such as water and transportation , which is essential for the people living in those areas. The market failure here is wildfires. Because of the negative externality, we aren’t generating enough total surplus at the market equilibrium which results in a market failure.\n\nBest,\nEcon 101 student\nWord count: 500/500\n",

      "essay": "To: econstudent@umich.edu\nFrom: yourfriend@umich.edu\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nTo help you understand the concept of market failure, I found an example in a recent Wall\nStreet Journal article about the Smokehouse Creek Fire. This fire began in Texas on February 26,\n2024. In an investigation, the state of Texas found that the power lines implemented by the\nelectric utility delivery company in the area, Xcel Energy, caused the ignition of the fire (Otis,\nMarchese). In order to explain how this exemplifies market failure, I first should define a few\nkey concepts. As you know from this class, a specific market for a good or service is at\nequilibrium when the quantity demanded by consumers and the quantity supplied by producers\nare equal. The market naturally moves toward the goal of reaching an equilibrium quantity.\nEquilibrium, however, isn’t always the efficient outcome (or the maximization of total surplus) in\nthe market. Market failure happens when the market doesn’t reach an efficient outcome, even at\nequilibrium. There are a number of types of market failure, but the one I will focus on is market\nfailure that occurs when there is an externality present in the market. An externality is an\nunintentional consequence of market activity that impacts outside parties who are not the\nproducers or consumers involved in the activity. When there is a benefit or cost in the market that\nis uncompensated for by the equilibrium quantities supplied and demanded, total surplus isn’t\nmaximized and the market fails. An uncompensated cost is otherwise known as a negative\nexternality, and an uncompensated benefit is a positive externality.\nIn the case of the Smokehouse Creek Fires, we are discussing market failure caused by a\nnegative externality. The market we are considering is the energy utility market, in which Xcel\nEnergy, the producer, sells power lines, the good, to the state of Texas, the consumer. The goal of\nXcel Energy is to meet the market demand for power lines, but as they are trying to do this, there\nis an unintended consequence of their power lines being used: wildfires (and thereby property\ndestruction). This uncompensated cost in the market results in deadweight loss, which means\nthere is a cost in the US energy market that is equal to the difference between the efficient\nquantity and the equilibrium quantity. At an efficient quantity, the externality of wildfires would\nbe eliminated. Thus, equilibrium in the energy utility market isn’t efficient because, as we know\nfrom the Smokehouse Creek Fires, at equilibrium there is still this uncompensated cost and\ndeadweight loss. Notably, market failure happens when there is no intervention in the market\nfrom outside parties such as the government. With intervention in the production or consumption\nof power lines, the externality of wildfires can be compensated for and the market can move\ntowards efficiency.\nI hope this explanation is helpful. Please keep in mind that externalities are just one way\nthat markets fail to maximize total surplus. Still, understanding this particular situation involving\nan externality will enhance your understanding of what market failure practically looks like.\nBest,\nY our Friend\nWord Count: 500\nWorks Cited\nOtis, Ginger Adams, and Marchese, Adriano. “Power Lines Sparked Largest Wildfire in Texas\nHistory.” Wall Street Journal, 7 March 2024, https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-\nenvironment/xcel-energy-review-shows-texas-wildfires-may-have-started-at-its-facilities\n18784c69?mod=energy-oil_more_article_pos2.",

      "essay": "Hey friend,\nI hope this email finds you well. I hear you need to understand the concept of market\nfailure. Market failure is when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not\nefficient, leading to a misallocation of resources and a failure to achieve the optimal outcome for\nsociety as a whole. When market failures occur, there is a role for government intervention to\ncorrect them and improve economic efficiency. This may involve implementing regulations,\nproviding public goods, and correcting externalities through taxes or subsidies. Market failure\ncan happen in a number of ways , a few of which we have covered in class recently. Those being\nexternalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. To give you a more\nin depth picture, I will go into detail about one of the forms. I will present an overview and\narticle example of externalities.\nExternalities are the spillover effects of economic activities that affect third parties who\nare not involved in the original transaction and do not receive compensation for these effects.\nExternalities can be either positive or negative. No matter positive or negative, both have distinct\neffects upon the market. When there’s an externality, the market fails to be socially efficient.\nNegative externalities result in too many units of the good at market equilibrium compared to the\nefficient amount. Positive externalities result in too few units of the good at market equilibrium\ncompared to the efficient amount.\nA Washington Post journalist, Rachel Siegel, published an article on March 15, 2024\nabout a new settlement agreed upon by the National Realtors Association. Although the\nsettlement was for the benefit of the realtors, a third party incurred an effect. The home buyers.\nDue to the new settlement, home prices are expected to drop. That’s because the sticker price\nwill no longer come with steep commissions that are typically automatically accounted for.\nOverall, economists estimate that the changes could cut the U.S. consumers' pay in real estate\ncommissions by $30 billion (Siegel 2024). This would be an example of a positive externality.\nBuyers will pay lower prices for homes, which means overall they save money. This will create\nfailure in the housing market. At equilibrium, there will be too few homes to keep up with the\ndemand. To bring the market up to the optimal outcome, there must be an increase in supply.\nTherefore a subsidy will be placed on building homes. The subsidy would go to the producer, for\nthe amount of the social benefit caused by the externality. This would result in a shift right of the\nsupply curve, thus bringing the market to the efficient outcome. For future reference refer to the\narticle at “https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/15/national-association-realtors”.\nGood luck in Econ 101 the rest of the semester!\nWord Count: 468",

      "essay": "Market failure occurs when a market fails to reach the most efficient outcome in the allocation of goods or services, in the absence of government intervention. Although equilibrium may be reached in this market, the total surplus has not been maximized and therefore the most efficient outcome will not be reached. Total surplus is society’s net gain from the market and is maximized when society’s marginal cost intersects (or matches) marginal benefit. Essentially, there can be an adjustment to the market that would increase total surplus, despite equilibrium being reached. \n\tOne economic concept that can result in market failure is positive or negative externalities. Externalities occur when the production or consumption of goods and services unintentionally affects third parties not involved in the original transaction. In positive externalities, this results in additional benefit that is conferred on the third party, without the individual or company involved in the transaction receiving any compensation. In negative externalities, this results in uncompensated cost imposed on the third party. These externalities cause equilibrium to not be the most efficient outcome a market can obtain. With a positive externality, the market could produce or consume more of a good or service to maximize the positive effect on the third party. With a negative externality, the market could product or consume less of a good or service to minimize the negative effect on the third party. \n\tOne tangible example of a positive externality is reflected in a recent New York Times article titled, “Older Americans Should Get Another Covid Shot This Spring, C.D.C Says” (NYT). In this article, the benefits of vaccinations for all Americans are discussed in tandem with the CDC’s recommendation for another COVID shot. The article highlights that vaccines offer genuine benefits to society that extend beyond those who actively choose to consume the product, stating “the agency recommended another round of vaccinations for Americans ages 65 and older” (NYT). A part of this reasoning from the CDC is the benefits of herd immunity. This occurs when a sufficiently large portion of a population is vaccinated against a disease. As a result, it becomes difficult for the disease to spread within the population, protecting even individuals who are not vaccinated. By recommending vaccinations to older Americans, the CDC intends to increase the number of people vaccinated and increase the effects of herd immunity to mitigate COVID-19’s spread. \n\tOutside of recommendations, governing bodies take considerable steps to increase herd immunity within society. Many vaccines are free or administered for reduced costs, particularly on college campuses and places with large populations in close quarters. Although this is costly, the benefits of herd immunity mean that the government is often willing to incur these costs to maximize the positive externality of vaccines and total surplus to society in general. \n\n[463 words] \nMandavilli, Apoorva. “Older Americans Should Get Another Covid Shot This Spring, C.D.C.

      "essay": "Dearest Friend,\nIn the market, there exists two equilibriums. The market equilibrium is the place where the\nquantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded, or the place where supply and demand meet.\nHowever, there is another equilibrium called the efficient equilibrium, where the social marginal\ncost is equal to the social marginal benefit. If these two equilibrium points are the same, the\nmarket equilibrium and efficient equilibrium are the same, and there is no market failure.\nHowever, when these two quantities are different, the market does not allocate its resources to\nthe efficient outcome and thus results in a deadweight loss.

      "essay": "Email\nTo: jbodian@umich.edu\nFrom: bburs@umich.edu\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure: An Example from Recent News\n\nDear James Bodian,\nI hope you had a great weekend.\n\nIn the midst of all, I hope this email finds you well. To assist you understand the idea of market failure, I have discovered a recent article from The New York Times that should be helpful.\nThe article “Shell Sees Demand Surging for Liquefied Natural Gas” that was published on February 14, 2024, by Stanley Reed talks about how Shell predicts that the demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will rise significantly on a global scale. The expansion of LNG infrastructure in China and the shift in Asia's emission reduction strategies from coal to gas are the main causes of this increase.\nLet's now examine how this article exemplifies a failing of the market. The negative externalities associated with LNG production and use are at the center of the market failure that has been observed. When a good is produced or consumed and expenses are paid for by individuals not directly involved in the transaction, this is known as a negative externality. When it comes to LNG, its production and use have a major negative impact on the environment. These include greenhouse gas emissions, habitat destruction, and contamination of the air and water.\nThe market frequently does not fairly account for these environmental costs. The lack of regulations makes this issue worse by enabling businesses to put profits ahead of environmental concerns. Businesses engaged in the production and consumption of LNG may put financial gain ahead of the detrimental externalities that are inflicted on the environment and society.\nDue to overproduction and consumption of LNG, which results in environmental deterioration and public health risks, there is a failure to absorb the environmental costs associated with LNG production and usage. The cycle of environmental deterioration and social injury is sustained by the absence of incentives for businesses to internalize these externalities.\nYou may see how market actors' pursuit of their own self-interest might result in outcomes that are not optimal for society by comprehending this example of market failure. It emphasizes how crucial it is for the government to intervene through laws, levies, or subsidies to mitigate negative externalities and encourage the more effective use of resources. Proactive policies that hold businesses accountable for their environmental impact and encourage sustainable practices are needed to address this market failing.\nI hope that my explanation makes the idea of market failure more understandable for you. Please get in touch if you need more examples or if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nBrett Burstein\n\nWord Count: 435\n\n \nWorks Cited\nReed, Stanley. “Shell Sees Demand Surging for Liquefied Natural Gas.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 14 Feb. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/02/14/business/shell-demand-liquefied-natural-gas.html.\n",

      "essay": "Hello Friend,\nI understand that you are trying to keep up with the coursework while you are at home.\nFor your benefit, I would love to help you better understand market failure.\nBroadly, market failure occurs when the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, thus\nfailing to maximize total surplus. This is caused by a failure of the market to allocate resources\nefficiently. Many different factors can contribute to market failure, such as externalities, common\nresources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nI've come across an article in The New Y ork Times that provides a real-world illustration\nshedding light on market failure. This article details the $500 Million Bahrain oil and gas project\nrecently approved by the U.S. Export-Import Bank. This project would increase the consumption\nof fossil fuels, thus increasing greenhouse gas and worsening global warming. The author further\ndiscusses criticism of the project’s disregard towards efforts to limit these fossil fuel emissions\n(Tabuchi).\nThis oil project can be directly linked to market failure in terms of a negative externality.\nIn essence, a negative externality is a negative impact of an economic activity on an unrelated\nthird party. Individuals fail to internalize an externality when they are not able to take the\nexternality into account. In the case of the article, the oil project will pose a negative effect on\nthe general public through the creation of greenhouse gasses and its subsequent effect on the\npublic’s well-being.\nThe burning of fossil fuels releases pollutants that can harm an individual’s health. This\ncan lead to heart attacks, stroke, asthma, respiratory disorders, and even death (Harvard T.H.\nChan School of Public Health). This creates larger costs for the general public through increased\nhealthcare expenses. This inevitably leads to market failure since the U.S. Export-Import Bank\ndoes not account for the higher healthcare costs experienced by unrelated individuals.\nFurthermore, the cost of healthcare for treating illnesses caused by fossil fuel pollutants is\nexternal to the market transaction between producers and consumers of fossil fuels. Thus, the\nmarket fails to internalize the externality and account for this cost of fossil fuel consumption,\nresulting in inefficient resource allocation.\nDespite these issues, there are solutions to market failure. Specifically, government\nintervention can assist a market in finding an efficient outcome. A few methods include taxes,\nsubsidies, quotas, and standards. For example, to better address the negative externality\nassociated with fossil fuel use, the government can impose an emission tax—a form of Pigouvian\ntax—based on the quantity of pollution emitted. This will ensure that the price of fossil fuels\ntakes into account healthcare expenses related to fossil fuel pollutants. It would also guarantee\nthat producers and consumers of fossil fuels will bear the full cost of their actions. This example\nserves as just one instance of how government intervention can be beneficial in addressing\nmarket failure.\nI hope this explanation and example were helpful to your understanding of the course\nmaterial.\nBest of luck,\nY our friend\nWord count: 494\nWorks Cited\nHarvard T.H.

I know you asked for help understanding market failure, so I‬\n‭ found and linked an article in the New York Times to help you better understand the concept.‬\n‭ However, I should clearly explain market failure before breaking down the article.‬\n‭ Market failure occurs when the market fails to be efficient. You should note that market‬\n‭ equilibrium is no longer equivalent to an efficient price or quantity in a particular market. The‬\n‭ market fails to be efficient due to, so far in the lectures, Externalities and Non-Private Goods.‬\n‭ Externalities are a type of market failure due to additional benefits or costs affecting a third party‬\n‭ that is not originally reflected in the market equilibrium price for a good. Externalities come in‬\n‭ two types: positive and negative. Negative externalities factor in additional social costs and‬\n‭ positive externalities require one to account for social benefits. Solutions for this type of market‬\n‭ failure are quotas and taxes for negative externalities. Since positive externalities go beyond‬\n‭ equilibrium, they require subsidies to reach an efficient price. Common Resources, Artificially‬\n‭ Scarce Goods, and Public Goods, also known as non-private goods, are inefficiently allocated as‬\n‭ they either fall under being non-excludable, meaning people can not be barred from use even if‬\n‭ they do not financially contribute, non-rival in consumption, meaning that one person’s use of a‬\n‭ unit of a good does not limit another person from using the same unit at the same time, or both,‬\n‭ respectively. This ranging availability in access to these goods makes the market unable to‬\n‭ efficiently distribute these goods, and thus market failure occurs.‬\n‭ The article I found for you is about how inhalers, EpiPens, and other personal medical‬\n‭ devices are not healthy for the environment. This article exemplifies market failure because the‬\n‭ environmental impact, of plastic waste, is not factored into the price of buying or producing‬\n‭ life-saving personal medical devices. When considering plastic pollution, consumers have to‬\n‭ evaluate their desire to maintain their health or the environment. This type of market failure is an‬\n‭ example of externalities, specifically a negative externality. In this market, the negative impact‬\n‭ these devices have on the environment adds a cost for consumers having to weigh their health‬\n‭ with the desire to be environmentally conscious and for producers the cost of researching,‬\n‭ producing, and distributing more ecologically friendly products. These external costs have to be‬\n‭ factored into figuring out the efficient price and quantity to be sold in the market. Therefore, the‬\n‭ social marginal cost with the externality includes the external costs and the marginal costs of‬\n‭ production. This results in this market-efficient price and quantity being more expensive for less‬\n‭ quantity than market equilibrium which fails to account for externalities. For this article’s‬\n‭ situation, to produce efficient distribution, imposing environmental standards in the market can‬\n‭ be used to decrease plastic use in the production of these devices.‬\n‭ https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/health/insulin-pens-inhalers-plastics-recycling.html?search‬\n‭ ResultPosition=13‬\n‭ Hope this helps,‬\n‭ Your Friend‬\n‭ Word Count: 479‬",

      "essay": "Hello!\n\nI am more than happy to help you better understand market failure.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand market efficiency. Market efficiency occurs when resources are put to their most effective possible use or where total surplus is maximized. Market failure occurs when these resources are allocated inefficiently. One main source of market failure is due to externalities. An externality occurs when there is a cost or benefit due to an activity that affects a third party. In a situation where there is a positive externality, an activity by one party creates a benefit for another party that they don’t have to pay for. Not all the social benefit of the activity is accounted for in the market. When this occurs, the efficient quantity is higher than the market quantity because the social marginal benefit is higher than demand. This means that the market will not do enough because the party creating the benefit is not being fully compensated for its benefit. However, when there is a negative externality, the opposite occurs. There is an uncompensated cost. The party creating this cost does not compensate for the harm they impose. In settings where this occurs, the social marginal cost is greater than the supply. This means that the market is going to do too much because the party creating the costs to society does not pay for them. Market failure occurs with externalities because resources are being inefficiently allocated: the market underproduces with a positive externality and overproduces with a negative externality.\n\nIn a New York Times article written by Hiroko Tabuchi, we can look at a real-life example of a negative externality. The article explains that due to human activities, such as mining and burning coal, there have been significant levels of mercury pollution (Tabuchi). In turn, microorganisms convert it into a toxic form in which many tuna fish become contaminated by (Tabuchi). People then consume the contaminated tuna and can suffer from nervous, digestive, and immune system-related health issues (Tabuchi). This is a negative externality because these costs are not accounted for in the market price of tuna and the polluters do not bear the cost of the mercury pollution. The polluters are overproducing because the efficient quantity, where the social marginal cost meets the demand, is less than the market quantity where this cost is not taken into account. \n\nOne potential solution to this could be for the government to tax tuna products that contain mercury to lessen the demand for them. This could shift the market quantity towards the efficient quantity. Another way would be for the government to impose a regulatory tax on emissions of mercury from human sources of the pollution. This would help decrease further levels of mercury contamination, and therefore the number of humans affected.\n\nI hope this helped your understanding of market failure.\n\nSincerely,\nYour fellow student\n\nWord Count: 477\n\nSource:\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Why Is Mercury Stubbornly High in Tuna?

Balancing\nfamily responsibilities and Econ 101 must be quite a challenge. Don't worry. I've got your back\nwhen it comes to understanding the concept of market failure.\nIn the field of economics, a market failure occurs when the way goods and services are\ndistributed in a market is not efficient, often leading to a loss in social welfare. Market failures\ncan occur due to factors such as externalities, insufficient provision of goods, excessive use of\ncommon resources and distortions caused by artificially limited goods.\nA recent article titled \"Utility Caused Wildfires Are Becoming a National Problem\" in The New\nY ork Times illustrates market failure, an externality. An externality refers to a cost or benefit\ngenerated by a producer that is not financially maintained or received by that producer. In the\ncase of wildfires caused by utility companies, the externality is the damage done to homes, lives,\nand the environment, which isn't reflected in the cost of electricity these companies provide.\nFor instance, in Oregon, PacifiCorp failed to turn off power lines despite warnings of severe\nstorms, resulting in a destructive fire outbreak. Failing to prevent the wildfire caused harm to\npeople, finances, and property (the negative externalities). The prices set by the utility company\ndo not account for the cost of these damages. As a result, the market where goods and services\nare exchanged freely (such as electricity) fails to consider the costs of the service provided.\nSo why do utility companies not take steps to prevent impacts? The article discusses solutions,\nlike burying power lines and using technology to shut down problematic power networks, but all\nof these preventive measures are considered public goods. They are accessible to all (those who\ndon't pay) and do not diminish when used by one person. Because no single company wants to\ncover the cost of these safety measures, there is a provision of them in the market, leading to\nmore frequent and severe wildfires. Moreover, legal regulations may create scarcities artificially.\nRules restrict access to resources, like electricity infrastructure. If regulatory compliance costs\nare high and fewer companies invest in safety measures, it results in a shortage of provided\nelectricity.\nIn conclusion, this wildfire issue illustrates market failure through negative externalities, the\nunder-provision of public goods, and the potential creation of artificially scarce goods due to\nregulatory challenges. Utility companies, while needing to maintain a reliable service, often do\nnot fully account for their operations' safety and environmental costs, leading to societal harm\nthat the market doesn't correct on its own. I hope this clears up the concept for you. Stay strong,\nand let me know if you need more examples or explanations. We all can't wait to have you back.\nBest wishes,\nA Friend\nWord Count: 470",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3\nMy friend,\nLet me catch you up on market failure.\nThere are many things that can cause market failure, but let’s start with positive and\nnegative externalities. This is when the production/sale of a good has an additional effect on\nsociety. With a negative externality, there is a cost being incurred on a third party that the\nindividual or firm is not paying for (ex. pollution). A positive externality is when incurs a benefit\non others without receiving compensation from third parties, like how vaccinations help\neveryone, not just the person vaccinated.\nIf you open the article I provided, you will see an example of a negative externality. The\nWillow Project is allowing more oil drills to be constructed in Alaska. By doing this there is\nincredible harm on the environment; not only from the oil drills themselves but from increased\ntransportation to that area, construction, building and flying from an airport, etc. (Herz). This is a\nnegative externality because the company is paying for the rights and ability to drill in that area,\nbut they aren’t paying for the negative impact that the pollution will have on society, so the\nmarket is not working efficiently.\nAnother way to experience market failure is through different types of goods. Every good\nis classified in two ways: if the supplier can prevent certain people from using it, it is excludable.\nIf one unit of the good can only be consumed by one person, it is a rival in consumption. A\nprivate good is the only efficient type because it is rival in consumption and excludable, so every\nindividual pays for their unit(s). But there are some other types.\nA common resource is something that is rival in consumption but nonexcludable. Clean\nwater, for example. At least here, clean water is available to anyone, however, only one person\ncan drink a specific cup of water. Because it’s nonexcludable but rival, there is going to be a\nsocial cost that is not paid for by the consumers.\nA public good is something nonexcludable and nonrival — it’s available and can be used\nby everyone. An example is snow removal. Snow removal is available to everyone, and more\nthan one person can benefit from it at one time. Even if someone isn't paying the taxes used to\nfund the service, they would still be receiving the benefits. This issue is called free-loading, and\nit causes the market to fail because not everyone is paying their part.\nFinally, artificially scarce goods are goods that are excludable but non rival in\nconsumption. Take Netflix for example. It’s excludable because you have to pay for your\naccount, but millions of people can be using Netflix at the same time, making it non-rival. This is\na problem because the marginal cost of someone watching the show is zero, so the efficient price\nwould be zero. However, companies want to cover production costs and make profit, so in this\ncase MC will not equal MB.\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nWORD COUNT: 499\nSources\nHerz, Nathaniel. “As Conoco’s Willow Project Advances, 2 Local Governments Have\nWithdrawn Their Criticism.” Alaska Public Media, Alaska Public Media, 10 Jan. 2024,\nalaskapublic.org/2024/01/10/as-conocos-willow-project-advances-2-local-governments-have-wit\nhdrawn-their-criticism/ .",

      "essay": "To: Friend\nFrom: Y our Peer\nThursday, March 21, 2024\nSubject: Market Failure\nGood afternoon friend, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to explain the\nconcept of market failure that we are currently learning in economics, as well as share a good\nexample I found that could be helpful.\nFirst, It is important that you understand what market failure is. As you already know, a\nmarket is in equilibrium when the quantity of supply and demand are equal. However, if a\nmarket is in equilibrium it does not necessarily mean that it is efficient. This is where the concept\nof market failure comes in. If a market in equilibrium is not efficient, then total surplus is not\nbeing maximized. This would mean that the equilibrium quantity is different from the efficient\nquantity, which is the quantity at which marginal benefit intersects marginal cost as you may\nrecall from marginal analysis. This can happen as a result of several different factors:\nexternalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. An externality is an\nindirect cost (negative) or benefit (positive) that is an unaccounted for effect on society. Common\nresources are rival in consumption and non-excludable, which can result in overuse. Public\ngoods are both nonrival in consumption and non-excludable, which can result in a lack of\nincentive for providing these goods as no one has to pay. Artificially scarce goods are excludable\nand nonrival in consumption, and led to inefficiency because the marginal benefit would be\nmaximized if they were free for everyone, yet must have a price. These market failures can be\nfixed by government intervention in the form of a subsidy or taxes and restrictions based on what\nkind of failure it is. For positive externalities or public goods where the efficient quantity is\nhigher, the government may subsidize these goods so that more are produced. For negative\nexternalities and common resources, the government may impose regulations or Pigouvian taxes.\nA solution for artificially scarce resources could be an alternative revenue stream that would\nallow all consumers to enjoy the benefits.\nOne real example I found that demonstrates market failure is in an article called “Major\nSources of Air Pollution: Farms” that I will cite below so you can access. This article is about the\npollution that farms generate and the negative impacts that pollution has on the environment.\nThis demonstrates market failure in the market for produce specifically due to a negative\nexternality because the pollution generated by farms is an uncompensated cost that they are\nimposing on their environment. This uncompensated cost of pollution is not accounted for in the\nmarket equilibrium, meaning that the efficient quantity for produce will actually be less then the\nequilibrium. The government could help this market reach efficiency by directly focusing on the\npollution by setting environmental standards or taxing the amount of pollution emitted, or by\nfocusing on the production by setting production quotas or taxing the produce.\nI hope this was helpful and urge you to reach out if you have any more questions.\n[word count: 497]\nReferences\n“A Major Source of Air Pollution: Farms - the Earth Institute - Columbia University.”\nColumbia.edu,\nwww.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3281#:~:text=All%20this%20said%2C%20agricul\ntural%20pollution.

      "essay": "‭ Writing Assignment #3: Market Failure Email‬\n‭ Dear Beatrice,‬\n‭ Markets are not always optimally efficient. The concept of ‘market failure’ occurs when a‬\n‭ market‬‭ , absent government intervention,‬‭ fails to reach‬‭ the efficient outcome, therefore not‬\n‭ maximizing total surplus‬‭ . As the source of change is not within the market, market failure cannot‬\n‭ be caused by government intervention. In class, we covered four types of market failures:‬\n‭ externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.‬\n‭ Externalities‬‭ occur when the creation and/or consumption of a good either positively or‬\n‭ negatively affects a third party unrelated to the market interaction itself.‬‭ For example, vaccines‬\n‭ benefit people who don't get them by reducing contagion, thus a positive externality. Pollution,‬\n‭ produced by gas/fuel consumption, is not accounted for in the cost of the good but is detrimental,‬\n‭ thus a negative externality.‬‭ Goods with negative/positive externality have an efficient quantity‬\n‭ below/above equilibrium quantity respectively, resulting in market failure.‬\n‭ Common resources‬‭ are non-excludable goods, meaning there are no barriers to consumption‬\n‭ (i.e. price), and they are rivalrous, meaning that one unit can only be consumed by a single user.‬\n‭ An example of this is fishing in unowned bodies of water, where catching a fish means that‬\n‭ others can no longer catch that same fish.‬‭ Individuals consuming common resources without‬\n‭ restriction can cause resource depletion, resulting in market failure.‬\n‭ Public goods‬‭ are non-rival and non-excludable, such as fireworks shows.‬‭ Individuals may take‬\n‭ advantage of such goods without paying, creating market failure when there are not enough‬\n‭ resources to produce them.‬\n‭ Artificially scarce goods‬‭ are non-rival and excludable. An example of this is streaming on‬\n‭ Netflix. Netflix’s marginal cost is $0 when streaming a movie, yet they put a price on the goods‬\n‭ in order to afford the costs of production, which serves as a barrier to access.‬\n‭ There is a relevant New York Times article discussing transportation and mobility initiatives.‬\n‭ The transportation sector generates the largest share of carbon emissions (‬‭ EPA 2021‬‭ ) which is‬\n‭ extremely harmful to the environment. The FIA Foundation attempts to correct this negative‬\n‭ externality market failure by supporting development projects for mobility infrastructure‬\n‭ globally. By subsidizing such projects, the nonprofit takes into account the external costs of‬\n‭ emissions and enables the market to reach a more efficient‬‭ quantity, whereas before intervention,‬\n‭ the market price and quantity did not account for the cost to external parties.‬\n‭ Nevertheless, producers may underproduce or overproduce in an attempt to achieve private‬\n‭ benefit. This means that the market never reaches the optimal price and quantity where all parties‬\n‭ are content. Looking at a graph, the efficient quantity can be calculated by adding the third party‬\n‭ marginal cost to the private marginal cost, getting the overall social marginal cost. Using that‬\n‭ information, you can visualize where that overall marginal cost intersects with the private‬\n‭ marginal benefit (also the demand curve in this case) to find the new market equilibrium. This‬\n‭ shows how the market should behave by taking into account the negative externality created by‬\n‭ its actions.‬\n‭ I hope this helps!‬\n‭ Word Count: 499‬\n‭ Works Cited‬\n‭ Mohn, Tanya. “Helping the World Get Around More Easily — and Sustainably.”‬‭ The New York‬\n‭ Times‬‭ , 7 March 2024,‬\n‭ https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/women-watson-fia-mobility-qna.html‬‭ .‬\n‭ Accessed March 2024.‬\n‭ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.”‬‭ Environmental‬\n‭ Protection Agency‬‭ , 23 February 2024,‬\n‭ https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions‬‭ .

      "essay": "‭ Dear friend,‬\n‭ I know you are confused about market failures so I hope to clear it up a little bit for you.‬\n‭ Generally speaking, a market failure occurs when there is an inefficient distribution of resources.‬\n‭ This is when‬‭ absent any intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome even in‬\n‭ equilibrium.‬\n‭ In the article “Global CO2 Emissions Hit Record High in 2023, IEA Says,” the author‬\n‭ discusses global CO2 emissions in 2023. She discusses various countries and areas around the‬\n‭ world and goes into detail with numbers on energy combustion, emissions, and electricity output‬\n‭ (Petroni, 2024).‬‭ This form of market failure is characterized by a negative externality, as the‬\n‭ emissions generated as a byproduct of CO2 production are not solely absorbed by the‬\n‭ organizations responsible but also impact society at large.‬\n‭ In this article, there are many examples but one thing that is discussed is the CO2‬\n‭ emission that is produced when fossil fuels are burned for energy. The idea is that the CO2 that is‬\n‭ the byproduct doesn’t just affect the factories negatively but everyone in society. Some of the‬\n‭ ways it can hurt society are a decrease in tourism, a higher cost of health care, and an overall‬\n‭ decreased quality of life. It is a cost to society, not just the private producer. This means that the‬\n‭ social cost curve is higher than the private cost curve since the private cost curve doesn’t account‬\n‭ for the costs society shares. With a negative externality like CO2 emissions, the social cost‬\n‭ increases as the production of the burning of fossil fuels for energy increases so there is an‬\n‭ overproduction of fossil fuels burned. This means there is a deadweight loss because of the‬\n‭ economic benefit lost due to this negative externality.‬\n‭ The article mentions that globally, countries should be making more efforts to increase‬\n‭ investment in clean-energy sources in emerging economies (Petroni, 2024). The reason for that is‬\n‭ because the byproduct, which is CO2 emissions, affects the entire world, not just the country that‬\n‭ produces the energy for themselves.‬\n‭ What is tough to calculate is how much it costs externally to produce every extra unit of‬\n‭ energy. In class, it is simplified, and it is assumed that every extra unit of the good produced,‬\n‭ results in the same amount of cost. There are a couple of different things the government could‬\n‭ do to pursue efficiency in the market. The government could create a policy in the energy market‬\n‭ to reduce the burning of fossil fuels. Unfortunately, this affects the entire market so nuclear‬\n‭ power and other cleaner energy sources are also affected. The government can directly target the‬\n‭ CO2 but it is tough to measure how much is produced since different fuels emit different‬\n‭ amounts of CO2.‬\n‭ I hope this helped you understand a little bit more about market failures and negative‬\n‭ externalities specifically.‬\n‭ Kind regards,‬\n‭ Your classmate‬\n‭ (474 words)‬\n‭ Petroni, G.

      "essay": "March 25, 2024\nDear friend,\nA real-world scenario regarding microplastics can help you better understand market failure.\nMarket failure occurs when, absent government intervention, the market fails to reach an\nefficient outcome where total surplus is maximized, and society gets maximum net gain.\nHowever, when total surplus is not maximized, a dead weight loss is incurred, hence the market\nfails to achieve efficiency.\nTo better understand this concept, microplastics are an example of market failure. Microplastics\ncome from plastic goods, food containers, PVC pipes, clothing, etc., and end up in our\necosystem. As a result, these microplastics end up in our bodies, causing an array of health\nissues. For example, microplastics are now found in the human placenta, breast milk, brains, and\ncardiovascular systems. As a result, \"these synthetic, foreign bodies pose a threat to human\nhealth\" (Jacobs). The negative impact on human health poses a market failure.\nThe microplastic's impact on human health is a negative externality, an example of market\nfailure. A negative externality incurs an uncompensated cost that the individual or firm imposes\non a third party. The two parties, producers and consumers of plastic goods, fail to consider\nnon-participants that microplastics could negatively impact. In this situation, the private marginal\ncost is considered; this is the supply curve or the marginal cost curve, but the social marginal\ncost is not accounted for. The social marginal costs consider total external costs, which are the\nnon-participants and the health issues that could be incurred due to the consumption and\nproduction of plastic. This results in inefficiency, negative total surplus, or deadweight loss,\nwhich harms the third party. With negative externalities, the market quantity exchanged is greater\nthan the efficient quantity exchanged. This is because efficiency is when total surplus is\nmaximized when social marginal cost is equivalent to social marginal benefit. However, because\nthe excess marginal cost is not accounted for, equilibrium occurs at a higher quantity. However,\nthe quantity is lower at efficiency because the external cost is considered.\nRegarding the example with microplastics, the amount of plastic being exchanged is greater than\nthe efficient quantity because the detrimental health impacts are not being considered. When\nproducers and consumers engage in the market, they do not account for when their microplastics\nend up in \"marine life\" or \"fisheries\" (Jacobs). They are then found in another person's \"fatty\nplaque that clings to the walls of blood vessels,\" which can \"block the flow of blood in a smaller\nvessel and prompt a heart attack or stroke\" (Jacobs). Monetarily, this can result in hospital bills,\nan uncompensated cost that the consumer/producer brought upon someone not considered part of\ntheir private marginal cost.\nThe market for plastic will only be considered efficient or not a market failure if the private\nmarginal cost curve meets the social marginal cost curve; this can be achieved by taxing plastic\nitself or the microplastic pollution it creates. Hopefully, this helps your confusion regarding\nmarket failure, as microplastics result in an uncompensated cost that the market fails to consider,\nresulting in inefficiency.\nSincerely,\nYour friend\nWord Count: 499\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew.

      "essay": "Dear classmate,\nI hope everything is going well back home! In class today, we discussed market failure.\nMarket failure occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even in equilibrium\n(Dudley). Efficiency is when total surplus is maximized, but in market failures total surplus fails\nto do so. The types of market failure we discussed in class are negative and positive externalities.\nNegative externalities is the uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others,\nalso known as external cost (Dudley). On the other hand, positive externalities is the benefit an\nindividual or firm places on others without knowing, also known as external benefit (Dudley).\nIt’s important to understand that positive and negative externalities are benefits and costs that are\nnot thought of when the decision or action occurs, but still occurs.\nMarket failure can be a difficult concept to grasp. To help you better understand it, I drew\non a current example. The Biden administration is attempting to limit pollution from power\nplants and other industrial facilities that are causing problems for states that are downwind\n(Barnes). The implementation of power plants and other industrial facilities have led to an\nincrease in unhealthy air in downwind states, mainly in Eastern states. Many of these impacted\nstates have stated that they are unable to meet federal air quality standards without the help of\ngovernment intervention (Barnes). This is a perfect example of a market failure, specifically a\nnegative externality. A market failure occurs when the market equilibrium fails to account for the\nexternality, therefore not generating as much total surplus as possible (Dudley). In this case, the\npower plants and industrial facilities have produced energy as well as an abundance of pollution,\naffecting an unexpected group: downwind states. The installment of these facilities creates an\nuncompensated cost of pollution on downwind states, making it a negative externality. When a\nnegative externality occurs, it impacts the market equilibrium and changes the overall total\nsurplus. In addition, we get an efficient quantity, which is created by the intersection of the social\nmarginal cost and the consumer's marginal benefit (Dudley). The social marginal cost refers to\nthe cost that society has to pay due to the production or use of a particular good or service. With\nthe power plants, the downwind societies are paying the cost of polluted air that can’t even pass\ngovernment standards. The external cost, paid by both consumers and producers decreases both\nparties' surplus, but increases the deadweight loss, also known as negative total surplus,\nassociated with market equilibrium (Dudley). Both parties see a decrease in surplus due to the\nexternal cost of a negative externality, therefore total surplus also see’s a decrease. The increase\nin pollution caused by power plants and other industrial facilities, has caused an unforeseen\nburden on downwind states, making it a negative externality and causing a market failure. I hope\nthis has helped you understand market failure.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/20/supreme-court-epa-pollution-downwind-st\nates/.\nSincerely,\nY our Classmate\nWord Count: 496\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externality.” Class Lecture, Economics 101, University of Michigan, Lorch\nHall, 5 March, 2024.\nBarnes, Robert. “Supreme Court to Review EPA ’s Power to Curb Downwind Pollution.” The\nWashington Post, 20 December, 2023.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/20/supreme-court-epa-pollution-down\nwind-states/.",

      "essay": "Good morning Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well! I wanted to touch base with you about “Market Failure”, and what it means since I know that you could not make it to class.\nEssentially, market failure is when the free market, left to its own devices, doesn't allocate resources efficiently. In other words, sometimes the way things work out in the market isn't in everyone's best interest. There are also different types of market failures.\nOne type of market failure that I came across in a recent article is a negative externality. Negative externalities occur when the production or consumption of a good or service imposes costs on third parties who are not directly involved in the exchange. Essentially, it's like a side effect of economic activity that affects people who aren't even a part of the buying or selling process. When looking at a negative externality and drawing it out, there is an “extra supply curve”. An example of a negative externality is pollution.\nThe article that I found highlighted a perfect example of market failure due to negative externalities. The article discussed how republican attorneys general from 24 states are challenging the Biden administration's decision to tighten limits on fine industrial particles, citing potential cost increases, while the EPA argues it would save lives. The lawsuits, led by Republican attorneys general, argue that the EPA overstepped its authority in lowering the annual limits for fine particulate matter, starting a debate over environmental regulations and their impact on industry. The controversy emphasizes the ongoing tension between environmental protection and economic concerns, with both sides presenting valid arguments regarding health benefits and potential economic challenges. Pollution is a negetive externality, and its negative effects on public health is a classic case of a negative externality leading to market failure.\nUnderstanding market failure is crucial because it helps us recognize when the free market alone isn't enough to ensure the best outcomes for society as a whole. In cases like the one mentioned in the article, there's a role for government intervention to address the externalities and ensure that resources are allocated more efficiently.\nI hope this explanation helps shed some light on the concept of market failure! Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to dive deeper into this topic.\nBest regards,\nYour classmate\nArticle referenced:\nFriedman, Lisa. “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P.A.

      "essay": "To: Kevin Smith\nFrom: \nSubject: Market Failure\nDate: March 24th, 2024\nDear Kevin, \nUnderstanding market failure can be a difficult task, but I am here to help clarify it for you. Market failure is defined as when the market has an uneven distribution of goods and services, which leads to inefficiency. As a result, this causes deadweight loss because the supply and demand are not in equilibrium.\nThere are many causes of market failure, with two common effects being negative and positive externalities. A negative externality impacts someone, not involved in a certain situation, negatively. An example of this would be pollution from a factory. The people who live nearby get affected by the pollution while the companies make money from the production inside the factories. On the other hand, a positive externality is the opposite in that the people are positively affected by something outside their control. A common example of this would be if someone were to work very hard on their front yard to make it look better. This would only help the surrounding houses by making their value go up without doing anything. \nIf you are still confused about market failure, I will give you an example that will hit home for you. I know that you are someone who uses insulin daily. As you probably know, the cost of insulin has been very high for quite some time. The prices are high because insulin is an artificially scarce good due to pharmaceutical companies controlling distribution through high prices. (Nehamas) The demand for insulin will always be there so the companies can control their supply with high prices to make a profit. As referenced in the New York Times article titled “Biden Pushes Lower Health Care Costs and Takes a Dig at Trump, “Biden plans to cap insulin prices at $35 per month for all consumers” (Nehamas). His objective is to reduce healthcare costs for Americans while highlighting the issue of Big Pharma profiting from these costs. The government wants to implement a price ceiling to return the market to efficiency. The market is out of efficiency because there is no equilibrium. As a result, the market for insulin needs government intervention to move the price to efficiency. (Nehamas)\n\tIn summary, market failure is when the market has an unequal distribution of goods and services. As you know now, many causes of market failure can be positive or negative. Additionally, another cause of market failure is called an artificially scarce good. These goods can cause the market to be inefficient which brings us back to the main topic of market failure. \nSincerely,\n\nWord Count: 468 Words\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nNehamas, Nicholas. “Biden Pushes Lower Health Care Costs and Takes a Dig at Trump.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 11 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/us/politics/biden-health-care.html. \n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Market failure occurs when the market fails to achieve efficiency, resulting in a suboptimal\nallocation of resources and a failure to maximize total surplus. Negative externalities, a type of\nmarket failure, occur when the actions of producers and consumers impose costs on third parties\nwho are not involved in the transaction. This leads to a misallocation of resources as the market\nequilibrium does not fully account for these external costs, resulting in deadweight loss.\nIn the case of negative externalities, market efficiency occurs when the social marginal cost\n(including the external cost) equals the marginal benefit represented by consumer demand.\nHowever, in the presence of negative externalities, the market equilibrium does not consider the\nadverse impacts on third parties, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources.\nAn illustrative example of a negative externality is evident in the attached article titled \"Weirdly\nWarm Winter Has Climate Fingerprints All Over It, Study Says.\" The article highlights how the\nburning of fossil fuels has contributed to unusually warm winter temperatures globally, with\nFebruary 2024 marking the hottest February on record (Sengupta & Erdenesanaa, 2024).\nMoreover, the impact of human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, is underscored by\nextreme temperature variations observed in major cities worldwide - namely in North America,\nEurope, and Asia (Sengupta & Erdenesanaa, 2024).\nThe article's emphasis on the widespread effects of climate change, with 4.8 billion people\nexperiencing temperatures influenced by carbon pollution, exemplifies the negative externality\nassociated with environmental degradation (Sengupta & Erdenesanaa, 2024). Pollution from\nfossil fuel combustion not only affects the immediate buyers and sellers but also imposes costs\non society at large, illustrating the far-reaching consequences of negative externalities. This is\nbecause the costs on society associated with pollution are not a part of the price of the goods\nwhich produce pollution.\nThis article serves as a poignant reminder of the detrimental impacts of negative externalities, as\npollution transcends geographical boundaries and adversely affects global populations. For\nexample, pollution leads to climate change and health problems for people worldwide. Since\npollution is a market failure, it means that the market equilibrium quantity is greater than the\nefficient quantity, so there is overproduction of goods that have pollution as a byproduct. This\nalso means that society is experiencing deadweight loss, therefore losing money, by remaining at\nthe market equilibrium with overproduction of these goods.\nIn order to fix this problem of the negative externality, the government may impose taxes on\neither pollution itself, or the goods that cause pollution in hopes of decreasing the quantity\nsupplied, making the market efficient.\nWord Count: 414\nReferences\nSengupta, S., & Erdenesanaa, D.

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\nI understand you have missed class, so I will do my best to explain a market failure to you. In general, a market failure occurs when the equilibrium quantity traded does not equal the efficient quantity for society in a given market, even when unregulated by the government. Another way to put it is that society as a whole would benefit if the given market were to trade more or less than the quantity they are trading at equilibrium. \n\nMarket failures can take many forms. Some examples are classified as Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. Common resources are when the resource is unregulated but limited, so people often take more than they should in efficacy. Artificially Scarce Goods are when the good could be accessible to everyone, but there is a price to receive access. Those goods should theoretically be given access to everyone once they are made. Last is Public Goods, which have no restriction access or limit. These are extremely inefficient, as the provider can’t possibly receive compensation from the receiver. \n\n One example of a market failure that we covered in class was externalities. An externality is when a third party is affected by a certain market without ever having anything to do with the transition or with the buyer/seller keeping them in mind. There can be positive and negative externalities. \n\nA positive externality means that a third party is benefiting from a market, but because the buyer/seller does not have them in mind the trade is done at a lower quantity than the quantity that would be best for society as a whole. Vaccines are an example of a positive externality because society as a whole benefits from people getting vaccinated, not just those receiving the vaccine. A negative externality is the opposite. That means a third party is negatively affected and therefore the market equilibrium quantity is higher than would benefit society as a whole. A common example used in class was pollution. For example, the buyer and seller of a leather shoe do not account for the fact that the production of the leather is leading to pollution that is negatively affecting the air quality of the town next to the factory. \n\nTo further help your understanding I attached and cited a current article that involves a market failure in the form of an externality. The article is about wildfires that were caused by a powerline failure. The market failure here is a negative externality. Put simply, Xcel Energy is providing a product (energy) to consumers through their powerlines. However, as a part of doing that business, fires were created and burned down the property of nearby homes that do not all consume Xcel Energy.

      "essay": "1\nDr. Dudley\nECON 101: Principles of Microeconomics 1\n26 March 2024\nWriting Assignment Three: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nOf course I can help you understand this challenging market failure concept. Market\nfailure occurs when the market, without external intervention, fails to achieve efficient outcomes,\neven if reaching equilibrium (Dudley, 5). This definition particularly highlights the difference\nbetween equilibrium and efficiency, often misconstrued as synonymous. In regards to market\nfailure and societies inability to maximize total surplus while allocating resources (efficiency),\none sees how efficiency may not align with equilibrium (where supply and demand intersect).\nHopefully, this distinction of efficiency not equating to equilibrium clarifies any definitional\nconfusion.\nMoving on, market failure manifests in various forms, each presenting challenges\nregarding efficient resource allocation. The main forms include externalities, common resources,\npublic goods, and artificially scarce goods. To better grasp market failures complexities, let’s\nexplore a real-world example focusing on the example of externalities.\nIn a recent New Y ork Times article titled Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film\nWarns, readers uncover rising plastic usage issues. Despite being vital to many goods, plastics\ndegrade slowly into tiny particles known as “microplastics”. These microplastics have been\ndiscovered everywhere, from mountain peaks to the organisms we consume, and even “our\nlungs, our blood, [and] our feces”. One study highlighted how microplastics link to health issues\n2\nsuch as “inflammatory bowel disease…heart attack[s], stroke[s]” and even “death” by exisitng in\ndangerous areas such as the lungs and brain (Jacobs).\nThis article exemplifies the concept of market failure externalities, where an individual or\nfirm imposes an unintentional benefit (positive externality) or cost (negative externality) on some\nunrelated third party (Dudley, 4). Here, plastic productions continued high demand results in\nhigh plastic company production. Although beneficial for transactional parties, this negative\nexternality production creates an unaccounted for cost on nonplastic users (unrelated third party)\nwho consume microplastics from the environment and face serious health risks. Relating this to\nmarket failure, this external cost (cost of harming a third party) displaces the producer marginal\ncost (supply curve) to a higher social marginal cost because of the new recognition of third party\ncosts in society. This information reveals the point of efficiency which is where social marginal\ncost (new curve) and social marginal benefit (no positive externality so the original demand\ncurve) intersect, portraying the optimal point at a lower equilibrium quantity and higher\nequilibrium price. Using this new optimal equilibrium and old market equilibrium, to measure\nthe difference between the two, we find the value of deadweight loss, which represents the value\noffputing the market from efficiency (how much less plastic we should produce) (Dudley, 12).\nThe final related aspect is how to resolve this externality. While the article seemingly suggests\nthe “Coase Theorem”, which implies individuals reach efficiency if transaction costs are low, the\ngovernment can also intervene. Through standards or regulation (more expensive option), taxes,\nor permits and quotas on the externality or plastic market in general, the economy reaches this\noptimal efficiency point thus resolving the externality (Dudley, 16-17).\nOverall, I hope this market failure explanation, illustrated by the microplastic issue,\nclarified this concept.\nWord Count: 499\n3\nSincerely,\nEconomics Student\n4\nWorks Cited\nDudley, Mitchell.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nAs you have been away dealing with a family emergency, I wanted to write you to\nexplain better the happenings of Dr. Dudley’s Econ 101 lectures. Recently, Dr. Dudley has\nlectured on market failures. Initially, this topic can be tricky, but I hope this email helps you\nunderstand market failures better.\nSimply put, market failures occur when society’s free market allocation of goods and\nservices is inefficient. They typically have adverse effects on society’s welfare as a whole. A\nprime example of market failure is externalities. Externalities are when the external cost to\nsociety of producing a good is not reflected by the free market’s price for a good, leading to the\noverproduction of goods with negative costs to society and the underproduction of goods with\npositive benefits to societies. These are respectively called negative and positive externalities.\nThe New Y ork Times recently wrote about the Biden Administration’s plan to combat the\nnegative externality of air pollution (Friedman 2024). The market failure comes from the fine\nparticulate matter created by factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities, impacting\npeople's lives that are not directly involved in the industrial markets. This is a negative\nexternality because these particles have been linked to asthma and heart and lung disease. People\nwith no role in directly purchasing refined natural gas are experiencing negative, harmful side\neffects from this transaction.\nExternalities can also be shown on the supply-demand curve we have been studying.\nBecause there is a negative external marginal cost, the social marginal cost, representing the\nsupply, is less than what supply is in the free market. Therefore, the ideal price of goods with\nnegative externalities is higher than the actual price, and the ideal quantity is less than reality as\nwell. Conversely, with positive externalities, the social marginal benefit is higher than the\ndemand, in fact, due to the external marginal benefit. Therefore, the demand for goods with\npositive externalities should be higher than the free market demand, meaning that the quantity\nshould be higher and the price should be lower. Examples of positive externalities include goods\nlike vaccines.\nGovernment regulation is the common way of addressing market failures. In our article\nexample, President Biden is attempting to address the negative externality through government\nregulation, specifically the EPA. Another way negative externalities are addressed is through\ntaxes to disincentive the production of goods with negative externalities. Oppositely, goods with\npositive externalities are incentivized with subsidies.\nI hope this helps you understand the missed material better.\nBest,\nEcon 101 Student\nWord Count: 417\nWorks Cited\nLisa Friedman. “Biden Administration Toughens Limits on Deadly Air Pollution.” New York\nTimes, 7 Feb. 2024,\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/climate/epa-air-pollution-soot.html?searchResultPo\nsition=4.",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI am reaching out to clarify any confusion you may have regarding market failures. A\nmarket failure occurs when absent any intervention, including government, the market fails to\nreach the efficient outcome (Dudley). This means that resources aren’t allocated efficiently.\nMarket failure can be demonstrated by externalities, artificially scarce goods, public goods, and\ncommon resources. Specifically, I will be focusing on externalities to address this concept.\nExternalities are uncompensated benefits or costs that an individual or firm puts on others. For\nexample, let’s take the market for personal medical use devices and the negative externality it\nposes. In the market for personal medical use devices without external impact, we have our\nconsumer and producer surplus being maximized at equilibrium. However, this does not account\nfor the fact that we have the issue of excessive plastic from medical devices causing damage to\nthe environment (Alcorn). This develops into greenhouse gasses, toxins, and harm to the world’s\noceans that in turn affect the surrounding communities (Alcorn). We have third parties that were\nnot involved in the production or consumption of the good having to deal with an additional cost\nof the good. When we consider this in the context of our supply and demand model, we see that\nwe now have a social marginal cost curve that is exceeding the producers' marginal cost curve.\nThis is because the social marginal cost curve takes into account the external cost, which is the\ncost of the environmental damage. The intersection between the social marginal cost curve and\nour social marginal benefit curve (in this case, the demand curve), becomes our efficient\nquantity. So in this representation, we can see that when we follow the market quantity that\ndoesn’t take into account the external cost, we have a deadweight loss that would have been\ntaken into account at the new equilibrium. That essentially shows the inefficient allocation of\nresources. When the cost isn’t being compensated by the producers, there is inefficiency in the\nmarket. With the production of personal use medical devices, producers aren’t accounting for the\nnegative impacts of plastic during production causing environmental impact, so they are\nproducing more than they should be. That is why the efficient quantity is lower than the market\nquantity. Referencing back to our knowledge of government controls, a possible way this can be\naddressed is through a tax at the price of the external cost or a quota at the efficient quantity.\nWhile this is just one example of a market failure, it can be used as a framework to understand\nthe way society can be affected by them.\nSincerely,\nY our Peer\nWorks Cited\nAlcorn, Ted. “Y our Inhalers and EpiPens Aren’t V ery Healthy for the Environment.” The New\nYork Times, The New Y ork Times, 26 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/health/insulin-pens-inhalers-plastics-recycling.html?searchResult\nPosition=17",

      "essay": "Dear friend, \nWhile you’ve been away, we studied market failure in class. A market cannot always produce the ideal outcome. Sometimes it experiences market failure, caused by externalities. First, a market failure means that absent of any interventions, including government intervention, the market fails to reach a sufficient outcome. In other words, the market does not maximize the total surplus, even in market equilibrium. In this scenario, the maximum total surplus is also called efficacy. In terms of externalities, there are two types, negative and positive. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. It is also called an external cost. Some examples of negative externalities are overgrown front yards or pollution because they create an inconvenience or even a threat to a third party who did not participate in the production of it. A positive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm coffers on others without receiving compensation. It is also called an external benefit. Some examples of positive externalities are well-managed front yards or vaccinations. The people who did not participate in managing the lawn or getting vaccinated still benefit from the results. The government can intervene by engaging with the externality directly or with the associated market for the good or service. Subsidies allow for the positive externality to be increased. Environmental standards can reduce negative externalities though it has a higher cost than other methods. Emission taxes and tradable emissions are also methods as they allow for the reduction of negative externalities. It also provides the least costly method. \nIn this article about the Biden Administration fining gas and oil companies for releasing methane, we can see an example of market failure and negative externalities. The article addresses how methane emissions pose a great environmental burden but companies are failing to take measures to address these costs. The Biden Administration is requiring oil and gas facilities to pay a fee for emission pollution as an attempt to control environmental degradation. The market failure in this situation is the pollution that oil and gas facilities pose on the environment without bearing the cost of their actions. People living and working in the nearby areas have to deal with the consequences of pollution even though they didn’t take any part in directly releasing it which makes it a negative externality. Clean air, a common resource in this situation as it is nonexcludable but rival-in-consumption, is depleted as a result. The fee that companies are paying can be classified as emission tax which is a method for reducing the negative externality. \nSincerely, \nYour classmate\n\nWord count: 430\n\n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "To: friend@gmail.com\nFrom:\nSubject: Market Failure\nMarket failure can be a difficult concept to understand, but I hope this email will help you\nunderstand it. In the definition terms, market failure occurs when absent any intervention, the\nmarket fails to reach the efficient outcome even in market equilibrium. In simpler terms, failing\nto reach the efficient outcome means total surplus is not maximized. Total surplus is defined as\nthe total society’s net gain from the market. Society’s net gain, therefore total surplus, is\nmaximized where social marginal benefit is equal to social marginal cost. This is the efficient\noutcome, and the point each market tries to be at. When there is a market failure, this means that\nthe market equilibrium does not operate at that point where social marginal benefit equals social\nmarginal cost, so it is not efficient. We can see a market failure in the article cited below. The\narticle talks about the market for lithium and nickel and their use in electric vehicles, and how\nthere was a crash in battery metal prices and a slowdown in electric vehicle sales growth. The\narticle talks about how EV companies want to create cheaper vehicles to increase sales growth\nby using low-cost but high-polluting mines for metals. However, in this event, there is a market\nfailure due to the pollution released to the cities/places around the mines which will affect an\nexternal group outside the producers and consumers. This type of market failure is known as a\nnegative externality. By definition, a negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an\nindividual imposes on others. In this scenario, we see a negative externality due to the pollution\nreleased by low-cost mines that is also imposed on others, outside the consumers and producers\nof the mines. This means the social marginal cost is higher than the private marginal cost, as\nsociety has an external cost imposed on them from the pollution. The private marginal benefit\nand social marginal benefit are the same, as there is no external benefit, or positive externality,\nfrom this scenario. This indicates the market equilibrium, where private marginal cost is equal to\nprivate marginal benefit, will be at a larger quantity and a lower price than the efficient outcome,\nwhere social marginal cost is equal to social marginal benefit. The difference between the SMC\nand PMC is the magnitude of the external cost imposed by the pollution. This means at the\nmarket quantity, there will be a deadweight loss present as total surplus won’t be maximized.\nHowever, at the efficient quantity, there will be no deadweight loss since society’s total surplus is\nmaximized.\nWord Count: 431\nWorks Cited\n“The Boom in Battery Metals for Evs Is Turning to Bust.” The Boom in Battery Metals\nfor EVs Is Turning to Bust, The Wall Street Journal, 19 Feb. 2024,\nwww.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/the-boom-in-battery-metals-for-evs-is-turning\n-to-bust-5630493c.",

      "essay": "To: Friend\nI’m so sorry to hear about your family emergency, I hope that everything works itself out\nsoon. The primary concept you missed is market failure, which occurs when the market fails to\nreach the efficient outcome even in equilibrium, assuming that there has been no intervention\n(Dudley). It is crucial to note that efficiency is not the same thing as equilibrium, so be sure to\ndistinguish those two concepts when approaching market failures. There are four types of market\nfailures that we learned about in class: externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce resources. Externalities are essentially unintended effects a company or\nspecific venture has on others, and they can be positive (beneficial to society) or negative\n(detrimental to society). Common resources and public goods both involve overexploitation of\nnon-excludable goods (supplier cannot prevent the consumption of the good), but they are\nnon-rival and rival in consumption, respectively. The same unit of a rival good cannot be\nconsumed by more than one person at the same time (Dudley). Finally, artificially scarce\nresources are excludable and nonrival in consumption.\nIn order to help you better understand the concept, here’s a link to an article that\ndiscusses a market failure caused by externalities - climate change. The article specifically\ndiscusses an economic conference that recently took place, highlighting the economic effects of\nclimate change, and the importance of becoming more climate-conscious in various pursuits. The\narticle attached discusses negative externalities specifically, since climate change has had\nnegative effects on the economy, and contributing companies and factors have failed to bear the\ncosts. Research has shown that global “warming will take on gross domestic product – ‘an\nexternality,’” and how climate disasters such as “wildfire smoke [strain] household finances”\n(DePillis). This means that climate change has harmed the economy, and even certain pursuits\ntaken to curb its effects such as “wind turbine manufacturing” and “electric vehicles,” have\naffected economic fields such as “housing choices” (DePillis). Ultimately, climate change as a\nwhole has had dire consequences on both the environment and the economy, which is why many\nclimate economists are more concerned than ever about its effects.\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that climate change itself is a negative externality of\na booming economy, as manufacturing plants and businesses rarely consider how their\nproduction could be affecting the environment. Reports have shown that “100 energy companies\nhave been responsible for 71% of all industrial emissions” (Axelrod). Thus, production across\ndifferent fields and industries has directly contributed to climate change, making it a negative\nexternality.\nOverall, as a recap, market failures occur when the market is unable to reach the efficient\noutcome. There are various types of market failures, but the article specifically outlines\nexternalities, as it discusses how climate change has had negative impacts on the economy.

Here’s an attempt to explain that subject for you.\nMarket failure occurs when the free market cannot allocate goods and services efficiently,\nleading to a loss of economic and social welfare. Despite decisions that are rational from an\nindividual perspective, the outcome for society as a whole can be suboptimal. Common types of\nmarket failure include Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce\nGoods, which you mentioned you'd like to understand better.\nI found an article in The New York Times that talks about the negative effects microplastics are\nhaving on us and plastic pollution in the ocean. This is a classic example of a negative\nexternality. An externality is when the activity of an individual or a company has an unintended\neffect on others that is not reflected in the market price. Here, the production and consumption\nof plastics have a price for the consumer and a profit for the producer, but the negative impact\non the ocean and marine life is not accounted for. This creates a situation where the market fails\nto incorporate the true cost of plastic production into the price, leading to overconsumption and\npollution. Here's the article link: New York Times - Plastic People.\nThis failure to price in the environmental cost leads to more plastic being produced and\ndiscarded than is optimal for society. Neither the consumer nor the producer is directly held\naccountable for the cleanup or the environmental degradation, which means they have little\nincentive to reduce usage or improve disposal methods. This is where government intervention,\nsuch as taxes on plastic, subsidies for recycling programs, or outright bans on certain types of\nsingle-use plastics, can help to correct the market by internalizing the externality—that is,\nmaking the private cost more closely align with the social cost.\nThis case shows how important it is to understand the role of Externalities in market failure.\nSimilar issues can arise with Common Resources, like fisheries or forests, which can be\noverused since they are freely accessible; Public Goods, such as street lighting, which are\nnon-rivalrous and non-excludable; and Artificially Scarce Goods, which are artificially limited in\nsupply, often due to regulation or intellectual property rights.\nBy recognizing where and why market failures occur, we can better appreciate the need for\nregulations or other interventions to achieve a more socially optimal outcome. Hopefully, this\nexample helps clarify the concept for you. Once you're back, we can go over more examples\nand dive deeper into each type.\nLet me know if you need further explanation or if there's more I can do to help. We're all looking\nforward to having you back on campus. T ake care and stay strong.\nBest regards,\n(Your Name)\nWord count: 421",

      "essay": "Dear Fellow Classmate,\nI have heard about your family emergency and am more than happy to help you catch up with the\ncoursework and explain what market failure is to you. Market failure is often when the market is\nnot producing at the maximum efficiency and when goods and services are distributed\ninefficiently within the free market. Externalities, artificially scarce goods, common resources,\nand public goods are the four major types of market failure we've discussed in class thus far and\nI will briefly go more into depth for each one of them.\nThere are two types of externalities: positive externalities and negative externalities. Both can\nturn into market failure if a product or service’s price does not accurately represent what is\nreferred to as the efficient cost and benefit of that product or service. Keep in mind that positive\nexternalities typically benefit a third party/society, whereas negative externalities frequently\nharm a third party/society. Artificially scarce goods are a very good example of market failure as\nwell because they are excludable and nonrival in consumption. Hence, their efficient price to\nconsumers is zero, but producers must sell them at a positive price. Common resources have\nmarket failure because individuals who have access to them can use them in their own self-\ninterest, which can result in depleting the resource. Lastly, public goods can also lead to market\nfailure because they are non-excludable and nonrival in consumption. This means that those who\nchoose not to pay for them can still consume them. Understanding these four types of market\nfailure and how these in the market can impact society as a whole is important. We can measure\nthe effects market failure has on society using social marginal cost and marginal social benefit.\nThe socially optimal efficiency is when the social marginal cost is equal to the social marginal\nbenefit.\nTo help explain these concepts, I found a recent The Wall Street Journal article that shows an\nexample of market failure. This article talks about the start of the SunZia wind farm project by\nPattern Energy Group in central New Mexico. Wind energy can replace polluting energy and\nthus help the electricity market reduce its negative externality of pollution. Wind energy is one of\nthe combatants against climate change; thus, the market failure in this article is the positive\nexternality of these wind turbines, which positively impacts both society and the environment.\nThis shows a positive externality because the social benefits wind energy has on the environment\nand third parties are much greater than the private benefits of climate change. When producers\nare producing goods that contribute to clean energy whether it is through wind farms or other\nthings, they often fail to account for the impact it will have on others. So, deadweight loss\nbecomes a thing due to the society’s benefits outweighing society’s cost and in efforts to combat\npositive externalities such as this, governments typically give subsidies to help support positive\ncauses.\nFrom,\nA Helpful Student\nWord Count: 490",

      "essay": "Dear John Doe,\nI’ve received your email regarding your confusion on the topic of market failure. First, I\nwill explain the principles of market failure to help you understand the general concept before\ndelving into more specific examples.\nMarket failure refers to situations where the allocation of goods and services by a free\nmarket is inefficient, leading to a suboptimal outcome for society as a whole. One prominent\ncause of market failure is the presence of externalities. These are the effects of economic\nactivities on third parties that are not accounted for in the price mechanism. Positive\nexternalities, such as the benefits of education or healthcare to society, lead to underproduction,\nwhile negative externalities, such as pollution or traffic congestion, result in overproduction.\nAdditionally, common resources, which are rivalrous and non-excludable, suffer from the\ntragedy of the commons where individuals tend to overuse or deplete these resources due to the\nlack of property rights. Public goods, on the other hand, are non-rivalrous and non-excludable,\nmaking it difficult for private markets to provide them efficiently as individuals can enjoy the\nbenefits without paying, leading to underprovision. Furthermore, artificially scarce goods are\nthose for which the supply is restricted through artificial means, such as intellectual property\nrights, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes by restricting access and hindering innovation\nand dissemination of knowledge. Understanding these concepts is crucial for policymakers to\nintervene effectively and correct market failures through regulations, taxes, subsidies, or the\nprovision of public goods to promote societal welfare and economic efficiency.\nI’ve included an article that covers externalities to provide a clearer understanding of\nmarket failure using a real world example. The article, “SEC Approves Weakened Climate\nDisclosure Rule”, discusses the new regulations the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nis considering which would require companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and\ntheir impact on climate change. The particular market failure discussed here revolves around\nexternalities. Greenhouse gas emissions are a classic example of a negative externality. When\ncompanies emit these gasses in the process of their operations, they contribute to climate change,\nwhich has widespread and often harmful effects on society and the environment. However, since\nthese effects are not factored into the costs incurred by the companies, they have little incentive\nto reduce their emissions voluntarily. As a result, there is a market failure where companies are\noverproducing emissions because they do not bear the full cost of their actions. The proposed\nSEC regulations fail to address this market failure because they would only be mandating\ncompanies to disclose their emissions to a certain extent. This would provide inadequate\ninformation of emissions to investors and the public about the environmental impact of their\noperations which will disincentivize companies to reduce their emissions.\nWord Count: 455\nWorks Cited\n“SEC Expected to Approve Weakened Climate Disclosures Rule -- WSJ.” Dow Jones\nInstitutional News, Dow Jones & Company Inc, 2024.\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/sec-climate-disclosure-greenhouse-gases-d57de27c?mo\nd=Searchresults_pos1&page=1",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\nI heard that you had a family emergency and hope all is well. Because of this, I know you are not able to attend Economics class. We are now beginning to learn about the concept of “Market Failure”, which I’ll help explain to you.\n\nAs explained in class, market failure occurs when, with an absence of intervention (even government intervention), the market fails to be efficient or reach its efficient outcome, also stated as maximizing total surplus, even in equilibrium. Market failure can happen in different ways in the market, such as through Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. \n\nTo assist in my explanation of market failure, I have found a news article in The Wall Street Journal that covers a market failure. This article describes how electric cars emit more particle pollution compared to gas-powered vehicles because of their heavier weight which causes the tires to wear more rapidly releasing toxic particles into the air. Given this topic, the market failure created is called an Externality. An externality is a cost or benefit that occurs to an uninvolved third party as a result of two groups interacting in a market. There are two types of externalities, these being positive or negative. Because this article talks about pollution, the externality that would occur is a Negative Externality. Since pollution has negative and harmful effects, when it arises as a result of market interactions, groups or individuals that do not participate in whatever the market deals with are faced with external costs and negative effects. \nRelative to the article, this market failure is caused by the market for electric vehicles. This involves the producers of the electric vehicles, including the tires, as well as the consumers of electric vehicles. When toxic particle pollution happens from usage of the tires of the electric vehicles, a third group that is not involved whatsoever, meaning they have not purchased or own or support electric vehicles, is negatively impacted and now faces external costs, demonstrating the negative externality. For understanding purposes, the third group and unaffiliated entity in this case from the article would be broader society that is present near electric vehicles. \n\nTherefore, through a negative externality the market has failed. It fails because producers must react to the social costs, these being the result or impact of their business on society. If they take into account the social costs of pollution, they realize that if they are required to pay these social costs they reduce pollution but produce less goods and increase their price. By not taking these costs into account they produce too much of the good. The outcome of this is that inefficiencies are created, which means that the total surplus is not maximized, and thus creates a market failure. \n\nI hope this information is helpful for you.

      "essay": "Dear Confused Friend\nMarket failure is when, without government intervention, the market fails to reach an\nefficient outcome for all of society (i.e., the market doesn’t maximize total surplus). This\ninefficiency leads to a misallocation of resources resulting in a deadweight loss. Market failure\ncan occur for various reasons one such being externalities. An externality is the unintended cost\nof economic activities that affect third parties who are uninvolved and don’t get compensated.\nThere are two types of externalities, positive and negative. Positive externalities occur when the\ntotal external benefit exceeds the benefit incurred by the producers and consumers, while a\nnegative externality occurs when the total external cost exceeds the cost incurred by the\nproducers and consumers. The social marginal curve is then dictated by the total external\nbenefit/cost and depending on which external factor it replaces the supply or demand curve. By\nusing the market, there are ways to combat an externality. For example, to remove the negative\nexternality the government can either tax or impose a tariff of the same size as the externality,\nand to increase the positive externality, the government can subsidize by the same size of the\nexternality.\nIn the article, Lithium liabilities: The untold hazard of the push for more American\nlithium mines, they discuss the liabilities of the proposed new lithium mines in the United States.\nThis article highlights the negative externalities if the lithium mines were approved as the lack of\nfederal rules on mining site consumption of water, the drying up of nearby groundwater\nmonitoring wells, and the majority of proposed lithium projects in the U.S. that intend to take\nwater from already stressed sources. The significant usage of water in new lithium mines is a\nnegative externality in the context of environmental damage. Without government intervention,\nthe mines would drain local water supplies to maximize profit by maintaining the equilibrium\nquantity of water demanded, and thus burden society with a shortage of water and cause the\nmarket to fail. In this article, the Social Marginal Cost curve lies above the efficient supply curve\nand intersects with demand which minimizes consumer surplus and increases producer surplus.\nThis article also discusses the concept of a common resource, which is another type of\nmarket failure. A common resource is non-excludable and rival in consumption, which means\nthat there is a non-enforced price or no price for that good/service and the same unit of good\ncannot be consumed by more than one person at a time. Clean water in the context of the lithium\nmines falls into this category since the water is free to everyone but can’t be used by everyone at\nthe same time without restriction. A market failure from a common resource means that the\nsocial marginal cost is higher than the private cost of using the resource, so the efficient quantity\nof consumption is lower than the market quantity and therefore results in a larger pool of the\nremaining resources.\nRegards,\nY our Classmate\nT oday, Reporters at the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism Usa.\n“Lithium Liabilities: The\nUntold Hazard of the Push for More American Lithium Mines.\n” USA TODAY, 2 Feb.\n2024,\nwww.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/01/26/lithium-mining-affects-water-su\npply/72344587007.\nWord Count: 499",

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\tI would love to explain to you the term \"market failure,\" as I know you were away and unable to be in class. It is essential to understand that market failure occurs when there is no intervention in the market, even government intervention, yet the market fails to reach an efficient outcome. In other words, the market does not maximize total surplus, even in equilibrium. So, even if the market reaches equilibrium, it may not be efficient, as if you recall efficiency is equal to maximum total surplus. To make this more straightforward, using an example from a recent article will be beneficial. A recent article that I've come across from the NYT highlights a situation that can be associated with the concept of market failure, specifically the role of Externalities in the economy. \nExternalities are unintended side effects of an economic activity affecting a third party rather than consumers and producers. A negative externality is when someone does something that affects others negatively, but they don't have to pay for it, such as pollution. A positive externality is when someone does something that benefits others, such as vaccines, but they don't get paid for it. \nThe article \"Biden Administration Toughens Limits on Deadly Air Pollution\" discusses the EPA's implementation of tighter limits on fine industrial particles, a common and deadly form of air pollution, under the Biden administration. It highlights the potential health benefits of the new rule and the objections raised by industry leaders concerning its economic impact. Despite the possible health benefits, industry leaders oppose the regulation, arguing that it could increase costs and harm manufacturing jobs. The EPA believes that the rule will prevent thousands of premature deaths annually and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost workdays. However, industry groups fear economic consequences due to the rule. \nThis article clearly illustrates market failure, specifically externalities, as it focuses on the issue of air pollution regulation. The EPA recently implemented tighter limits on fine industrial particles, which are a common and deadly form of air pollution. This shows the negative externalities associated with air pollution. These fine particulate matters may enter the lungs and bloodstream, leading to serious health effects like asthma, heart, and lung diseases. Long-term exposure to air pollution has also been linked to premature deaths. \nA specific example from the article is when industry groups express concerns about the economic effects of the regulation, predicting manufacturing slowdowns and job losses. While these groups focus on the potential costs to their industries, they overlook the broader societal costs associated with air pollution, such as healthcare expenses and lost productivity due to illness. This split between private and social costs demonstrates the negative externality in the industrial activity market releasing harmful pollutants.\nThe article clearly serves as a great example of market failure, particularly in the context of externalities. It highlights the importance of government regulation in addressing environmental issues and protecting public health.\nTake care, \nYour Friend\n(Word Count: 497)\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\nFriedman, Lisa. “Biden Administration Toughens Limits on Deadly Air Pollution.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 Feb. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/02/07/climate/epa-air-pollution-soot.html?searchResultPosition=4\n\n\n",

      "essay": "1\nDear friend,\nI understand you have some confusion on the concept of market failure, and I hope to\nhelp you better understand. Firstly, market failure is when the market fails to read the efficient\noutcome and does not maximize total surplus - even if the market is in equilibrium. It basically\nmeans that people are acting in their own self interests, and this causes the economic optimal\noutcome to not be reached, or efficiency to not be reached. There are different ways the market\ncan fail. There are externalities, which are unintended costs or benefits to a third party who is not\ninvolved in the consumption or production of something in particular. External costs are\ncorrelated with negative externalities, while external benefits are correlated to positive\nexternalities. I’m going to focus on negative externalities, and some examples can be pollution or\nalcohol. I recently read an article, “Changes in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19\npandemic: a longitudinal cohort study using smart-breathalyzer data” published by scientific\nreports. Basically, it was difficult to measure the consumption of alcohol because of quarantine.\nBut, the rise of personal breathalyzers or “smart breathalyzers” has made it easier for people to\nmeasure the consumption of alcohol during quarantine, and it was clear that alcohol consumption\nlevels have risen since COVID-19. This article portrays a negative externality, which is alcohol.\nIn the case of this article, there are many hindering outcomes for society. For example,\n“heavy alcohol consumption and binge drinking have been associated with an increased risk of\nviolence, poverty, several cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases''\n(Houston, Vittinghoff, & Marcus 2024). All of these negative outcomes are external costs. Third\nparties have to suffer violence that occurs or lose loved ones in drunk driving accidents, when\n2\nthey had nothing to do with the production or consumption of alcohol. This is a market failure\nbecause when consumers purchase alcohol, they are not paying for these external costs that are\nplaced onto society - these costs go unaccounted for. The market fails because the total surplus at\nthe equilibrium quantity is less than what it is at the efficient quantity. When looking at the\nmarket failure, the external cost is added to the cost of the supply of alcohol, which is the social\nmarginal cost. To find the efficient outcome, we have to find where demand meets the social\nmarginal cost. Then we calculate the total surplus at both outcomes and measure the difference\nbetween them, and that difference is the deadweight loss. Therefore, the market is not\nmaximizing the total surplus at equilibrium and the market is in failure, it’s not efficient. In terms\nof the article, the detrimental consequences from alcohol consumption would be the external cost\nadded to the supply of alcohol. We would see that total surplus is less at the equilibrium quantity\nthan at the efficient quantity. I hope my example and explanation of market failure helps you,\nand let me know if you have any questions.\nWC:493\n3\nWorks Cited\nHouston, P .D., Vittinghoff, E. & Marcus, G.M.

      "essay": "Market failure is certainly a concept that is complicated and encompasses a multitude of\ndifferent industries. In simple terms, a market failure means that the market is failing to get as\nmuch surplus as possible. When the market equilibrium does not maximize total surplus, that\nmeans that the market is failing to be totally efficient. This deadweight loss is measured from the\ndifference in the market equilibrium price and the efficient price, the latter taking into account\nthe external cost or benefit that an externality creates. Usually, the market is always searching for\nequilibrium, so externalities can cause a market failure when the optimal price is not being\nreached. One example of a market failure that has been going on for sometime is throughout the\nhousing market. The New York Times covered this in an article asking “What Comes Next for the\nHousing Market”. During a period of high inflation, the Federal Reserve was consistently raising\ninterest rates which made it harder for people to buy houses. This negative externality meant that\nhomeowners were selling at a higher price than people were willing to buy at. Therefore, there\nwas inactivity in the market while housing transactions were oftentimes inefficient, highlighting\na market failure. Especially in the post pandemic era, we have seen the housing market stagnate\ndue to efforts by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation. This article is covering that shift where\ncurrently, cheaper borrowing costs have the potential to create more transactions for housing.\nWhile the presence of interest rates in general will cause the market to not be completely\nefficient, we will see a lower amount of deadweight loss within the housing market.\nCompetition for private goods is something that is very important for a healthy economy,\nespecially for one that thrives on capitalism. While free markets in the United States have\nstruggled in the recent past, current trajectory suggests that they are back on the way up. While\nthis suggests a return to an efficient market, the truth is that the majority of markets will\ntechnically be “market failures”. In particular, the housing market will always have a plethora of\nexternalities that cause the efficient price to stray away from market equilibrium. Things such as\nsafety of the neighborhood, construction, and appearance of neighboring yards are not a price the\nbuyer or seller have to pay but may impact the true value of the house. These are all factors that\nwill remain constant, meaning that we will see more examples of market failures.\nWord Count: 419",

      "essay": "To: My friend\nSubject: Market Failure Knowledge\n\nHi, my friend!\nIf you are having trouble understanding the idea of market failure from Dudley's lecture, I am giving you an example to help you better understand it. In economics, a market failure happens when society suffers a loss due to the ineffective distribution of goods and services by a free market (Dudley). Various forms of market inefficiency lead to situations where individual interests do not coincide with the common good or, more precisely, when society does not receive the best possible exports from the market. When prices act as a signal to bring supply and demand into equilibrium, leading to the most efficient distribution of goods and services, and consumers enjoy a marginal benefit, we can say that the market is efficient and free of monopolies. In certain cases, when the market is unable to function normally, the equilibrium between supply and demand is upset, and the distribution of resources according to societal standards does not match what the market determines.\n\nCommon resources are a contributor to market failure, whether they are natural or artificial. An individual's use of another's capacity to access the same resource, as well as the difficulty in preventing others from doing the same, are both characteristics of common resources that make their identification non-excludable and rival. There is a widespread issue with shared resources known as the \"tragedy of the commons,\" which occurs when one person's actions go against the benefit of everyone (Krugman and Wells 503). Along with non-excludable and non-rival goods, public goods contribute to market failure. In this market failure model, their use does not affect the availability of other users, and no one can be stopped from using them. The issue of free-riding arises in relation to public goods because individuals can enjoy them without contributing to their upkeep, meaning they have no incentive to pay for them (Krugman and Wells 495). An easily observable feature of market failure is an externality, which happens when the production of a product or service impacts the costs or benefits of parties outside of the market transaction.\n\nArticle: With TikTok Under Fire, Brands That Rely on It Worry \nThe proposed limits on TikTok show how government laws intended at security may have far-reaching economic effects on stakeholders outside the government. These trends surprise fashion and beauty companies, which use TikTok for promotion and sales (Creswell). These firms now face hurdles after using TikTok's unique feature to reach a huge audience at little cost (Creswell). This is an externality, when entities pay for acts they cannot control. A ban could also hinder innovation and market dynamics, where TikTok has helped businesses compete with larger ones through creative content, weakening competition and reducing consumer benefits from a diverse and innovative marketplace, worsening negative externalities. A TikTok ban might cost people jobs and revenue, hurting the economy beyond companies.\n\nBest regards,\nYour friend\n \nWorks Cited\nCreswell, Julie. “With TikTok Under Fire, Brands That Rely on It Worry.” The New York Times, 24 March 2024, https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/business/tiktok-beauty-fashion-companies.html?searchResultPosition=1.

      "essay": "To: Friend\nSubject: Market Failure\nDear friend,\nI understand you are struggling with the topic of market failure and I want to help you\nunderstand it better. Let's start with the general concepts of what is a market failure. When a\nmarket failure occurs, the market has failed to be efficient, meaning the market doesn’t maximize\ntotal surplus. The inefficiency of the market means that everyone involved isn’t guaranteed to\nreceive the best outcome leading to a deadweight loss (Dudley). The market maximizes total\nsurplus when the marginal cost intersects the marginal cost as discussed in earlier lecture topics.\nThe result of market failure can be due to many reasons such as externalities, common resources,\nand public goods.\nAlthough there are other reasons for market failure, I will focus on externalities. To help\nyou understand what a market failure is, I'll give you a real-life example of an externality. But\nfirst, let me explain what externalities are. An externality is defined as the advantages and costs\nreceived by a third party who is not directly involved in the consumption or supply of the\nproduct. There are two sorts of externalities: negative externalities and positive externalities.\nExternalities cause a market failure since the market does not take them into account, resulting in\nan inability to reach the maximum total surplus (Dudley).\nAn article from the Washington Post, explains how the Xcel Energy Power utility\ncompany caused the major fire in Texas due to their equipment being unable to sustain the\nweather in Texas (Sacks). The article goes into depth about the cause of the fire and how many\nutility companies like Xcel have caused many other major fires in other states due to similar\nissues. This article is a great example of a negative externality that causes a market failure.\nThe Xcel Energy utility corporation distributes power lines to Texas and several other\nstates, resulting in a demand and supply market (Sacks). The suppliers are Xcel Energy, and the\ncustomers are residents of the states that use their energy. However, the utility company's market\nhas a negative impact on a third party, the environment. Because Xcel Energy is the principal\ncause of the catastrophic fire in Texas, they are imposing the external cost to the environment,\neven if they did not plan to cause the fire. The fire has had a major impact on the environment in\nTexas, resulting in a market failure because the utility company isn't taking into account the\ndamage its power lines are causing. The negative externality shifts the supply curve to the left,\nincreasing the social marginal cost. Due to the negative externality of causing wildfires in the\nenvironment, the market equilibrium produces too many units of the good in comparison to the\nefficient level (Dudley). Overall market failure fails to maximize total surplus resulting in\nefficiency. The result of market inefficiency has to do with multiple reasons as I discussed\nearlier. I hope my explanation and example help you understand what market failure is.\nWord Count: 499\nBibliography\nDudley, Mitchel. “Externalities”, 2024, University of Michigan\nSacks, Brianna. “Xcel Energy Power Equipment Caused Huge Texas Fire, Investigators Say.”\nThe Washington Post, 7 Mar. 2024,\nwww.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/07/smokehouse-creek-texas-fire\n-cause-xcel/.",

      "essay": "Dear Classmate,\nIn class this past week, we have focused on market failure, its classifications, and how to\nmeasure it. Market failure is an inefficient market allocation of goods or services (The\nInvestopedia Team, 2020). The market does not account for some societal impact, which means\nit cannot reach the efficient quantity or maximize the total surplus.\nI can best explain this concept through an article that focuses on the policies aimed at the\noverfishing of sharks, specifically for their fins and meat, and the unintended consequences.\nMarket failures have different classifications: externalities, public goods, artificially scarce\ngoods, and common resources. In this case, the article highlights the market failure that is a\ncommon resource, specifically the overfishing of sharks. A common resource has two significant\nqualities. First, it is nonexcludable, which means that there is no price that a consumer must pay\nin order to consume that good. In the context of the article, the supply of sharks is not restricted\nby any price, and individual fishermen are allowed to fish openly in the ocean for finning or\nshark meat. The second quality is that it is a rival in consumption; this refers to the fact that more\nthan one person cannot use the same unit of a good at a time (Dudley, 2024). So, fishermen on\nthe South Asian coast are dealing with a limited population of sharks and must compete with\nother shark fisheries around them within that limited population. Additionally, with the\nuncertainty of how many sharks could be available the next day and the inability to share a shark\nwith competitors, fishermen decide to maximize their profits by wiping out the shark population.\nBesides Asian countries that traditionally eat shark fin and meat, the market for shark\nmeat has interested other countries such as Brazil and Spain (Andreoni, 2024). This circumstance\nis a prime example of the free rider problem that we see with anything that is nonexcludable, in\nwhich people take advantage of not having to pay to enjoy the good (Dudley, 2024). As a result,\nthis led to the overfishing of sharks, which resulted in a massive depletion of resources and the\npossible extinction of endangered species of sharks in the future. We would see this impact on a\ngraph as the diagonal social marginal cost line being greater than the individual marginal cost, as\nthe market overused the common resource. This is a significant issue because the market does\nnot reach the efficient quantity.\nThe article mentions that some counteractive policies to stunt the overfishing of sharks\nare banning shark fishing in those regions or creating shark sanctuaries (Andreoni, 2024). In\nclass, we discussed the possible solutions of a Pigouvian tax on the market, which would have\nthe same effect as the overuse of the common resource and in which the supply curve would shift\nupward.\nRespectfully,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 460\nReferences\nAndreoni, M.

      "essay": "Hey friend!\nI hope being home is good. You said you were confused on the concepts of market failure\nthat you missed the lecture for so hopefully I can clarify it for you. A market failure is when the\nallocation of goods and services is inefficient, leading to a net loss in economic value. In market\nequilibrium the quantity demanded is equivalent to the quantity supplied and therefore we reach\nsome idyllic situation where everyone is happy. However, considering that all markets do not\nstand alone, the associated costs and benefits that aren’t calculated into the simplistic S&D\ncurves we are learning are called externalities. While there are many shapes and forms this\ncomes in, it's easiest to explain this by applying it to everyday examples. I know how much you\nlove T aylor Swift but bear with me. I just recently read an article in The Wall Street Journal about\nTaylor Swift’s Carbon Allowance. As you know, T-Swift is the No.1 recording artist in the world\nwith a humbling net worth of 1.1 billion dollars. Her Eras tour spanned 152 shows across 5\ncontinents. Her concerts have stimulated economic growth and investment, with some tickets\nselling for nearly $11,000. However, as her wealth and popularity accumulates, so do her carbon\nemissions. Within a three month time period, she produced 138 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This\npollution qualifies as a negative externality in market failure because it is an unintended cost in\nthe market of T aylor Swift concert tickets. She continues to emit carbon at a much higher rate\nthan a normal person, and therefore negatively impacts the environment. An issue with market\nfailure is finding ways to correct these mishaps in the efficient allocation of goods. It would not\nmake sense to ban T aylors Concerts, as there is still an inherent benefit to the consumption of\ngoods. In some cases consumers would quantify this social marginal benefit as high as $11,000!\nHowever, there are ways the government can attempt to quantify the negative cost associated\nwith the tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Most recently, the international pop-star has\nquelled criticism through the purchase of carbon offsets. These offsets function as an\nenvironmental indulgence, and are privately issued credits that can be earned by Green\nbusinesses that produce in eco-friendly manners. While this tentative band-aid on a bullet hole\nmay seem like a pragmatic solution, critics are quick to recognize that their consumption has a\ngreater influence on virtue signaling in the media rather than ameliorating the environment in an\neffective manner. Instead of incentivizing less carbon emissions by valuing the social marginal\ncost at its efficient quantity, it serves as an excuse to continue producing carbon attached to the\ndistant ideal of helping the environment. For these reasons, the market for T aylor Swift tickets\nproduces the negative externality of pollution and is an example of how the market fails to\nbenefit everyone through valuation and consumption at the efficient price.\nHope this helps,\nYour friend\nOpinion | T aylor Swift’s carbon allowance.

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nMarket failure means that absent any intervention, including government intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome. A market reaches an efficient outcome when it maximizes its total consumer and producer surplus. The market at equilibrium does not always maximize total surplus. Some causes of market failure are common resources, public goods, artificially scares goods, and externalities. There are two types of externalities, positive and negative. An example of a positive externality is a vaccine because one person getting vaccinated benefits themselves as well as others in society. A positive externality subtracts from the total surplus because the producers in the market are not being compensated for the societal marginal benefit of their good/service. A negative externality imposes an external marginal cost which negatively affects a third party in society. An example of a negative externality is pollution. When pollution is a byproduct of a good or service, it negatively affects all of society in a certain area. Not everyone who is negatively affected by the pollution is a consumer or producer in the market, so a third party is negatively affected by this market. \nAn example of pollution right now causing market failure can be seen on the West Coast. “For the better part of the past two years, the roughly 4 miles of beachfront in the San Diego County town Aguirre leads has been closed to swimmers by environmental regulators because of constantly high bacterial contamination” (Caldwell). The high levels of pollution in California waters are a result of infrastructure flaws and sewage discharge in Mexico. Pollution in California water has been an issue for several years however, this problem has become worse in recent years and is now causing serious health problems in those who swim and surf in the water. Some beaches have now been closed and labeled a serious health risk. A faulty water treatment plan on the U.S. side of the boarder as well as sewage discharge in Mexican waters caused pollution to flow up the water on the coast of California. The pollution in both Mexican and Californian waters is a negative externality to the environment and society’s health as a whole. “The poor water quality has raised health concerns and inflicted economic damage on beach communities whose local economies thrive on tourism” (Caldwell). The harm that this pollution causes to the water’s ecosystems, surfers, beaches, and local communities can be labeled as the total external cost of this externality and some of it is deadweight loss. This takes away from the total surplus of the markets associated with the sources of the pollution. \nWord Count: 432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nCaldwell, Alicia A.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing this email to you to help your confusion\non the term “market failure”. I will try my best to explain it in a way that makes sense.\nMarket failure happens when, absent any intervention (even government\nintervention), the market fails to reach the efficient outcome even in equailibrium. Up until\nwe learned about the term “market failure” we have maintained our simple assumption that\nequilibrium is efficient, but now we are acknowledging that equilibrium does not have to be\nefficient. Nevertheless, if we want to know either the market is failing or not failing we have\nto measure the market’s failure. And here is the process of measuring the market failure.\nFirst, we can identify the total surplus at equilibrium. Next, we can identify the efficient\noutcome. Lastly, we can measure the difference between the total surplus at equilibrium and\nefficient outcome. If the difference is not zero, we call the difference deadweight loss.\n(Dudley)\nTo illustrate the market failure, I brought an example from a recent Wall Street\nJournal article titled “Once America’s Hottest Housing Market, Austin is Running in reserve”\n(https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/once-americas-hottest-housing-market-austin-is-run\nning-in-reverse-94226027?mod=hp_lead_pos7). This article is discussing the rapid cooling of\nthe housing market in Austin, which was one of the hottest housing markets a few years ago.\nOne of the main issues highlighted in this article is the presence of externalities,\nwhich are costs or benefits that are not reflected in market prices. Austin’s housing market\nhad the influx of new residents, resulting in significant price increases in housing demand.\nHowever these high housing costs have also imposed external costs on existing residents,\nsuch as increased traffic congestion, inconvenience of public infrastructure, and potential\ndecrease in quality of life.\nThe Austin housing market did not sufficiently reflect these externalities in housing\nmarket prices, which prevented the overall allocation of resources for housing development\nbeing efficiently implemented. Therefore, in this case the failure to properly consider external\ncosts related to rapid housing development.\nIt is important to note that market failure can be caused by various reasons. The\nAustin housing market’s failure is one of the great examples to demonstrate how externalities\nand common resources can contribute to inefficient resource allocation and distribution.\nI hope this explanation helps you to understand the concept of market failure.

      "essay": "1\nTo: Absent Classmate\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure\nHello Absent Classmate,\nI know you missed the last Econ 101 lecture and understand you are confused\nwith the concept of “market failure”, so let me catch you up to speed!\nMarket failure is when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome, which is when\ntotal surplus is maximized, due to an inefficient distribution of goods and services. Typically, we\nsee the efficient outcome at the market equilibrium, but in this case, the efficient outcome is\nslightly different. It is located where the Social Marginal Benefit (SMB) and Social Marginal\nCost (SMC) lines intersect. I understand these concepts may be foreign to you, so let’s further\nunderstand what causes the market to fail.\nExternalities are one of the main concepts that cause market failure. There are two types\nof externalities we must understand: Negative and Positive. Negative externalities are the\nuncompensated costs that an individual or firm imposes on others. This includes things like air\npollution, industrial waste, and deforestation. Conversely, positive externalities are the benefits\nthat an individual or firm casts upon others without recurring compensation. Disease\nmanagement and education are some examples of external benefits. We represent externalities\nwithin the Supply and Demand diagram by utilizing the external marginal cost/benefit coming\nfrom the externality. In the case of negative externalities the market equilibrium results in too\nmany units of the good being produced, so the efficient outcome is where the market accounts\nfor the externality imposed on society. We get this by adding our marginal cost (MC) to our\n2\nexternal marginal cost (EMC), giving us our Social Marginal Cost (SMC). Similarly, for positive\nexternalities the market equilibrium results in too few units of the good being produced\ncompared to the efficient level. To find our Social Marginal Benefit we simply add our marginal\nbenefit (MB) to our external marginal benefit (EMB). For both externalities, at the point where\nSMB=SMC society’s total net gain is maximized and we are at the efficient outcome.\nTo better understand the concept of market failure, let’s examine the article “PFAS\nChemicals to Be Phased out of Food Packaging. Here’s How to Avoid Them”. This article\ndiscusses the impacts of food companies’ decision to begin phasing out the use of PFAs in\nfood-related products and health advice for US citizens going forward. PFAs are a diverse group\nof chemicals that resist grease, oil, water, and heat, and can be found in fast-food wrappers,\nmicrowave popcorn bags, and takeout containers. The chemicals have been linked to cancer,\nhigh blood pressure, and other health complications, but companies are attempting to shift their\nsupply to the SMC, stating that “it could take 18 months to exhaust the market supply from the\nlast date of sale of these products” (Amenabar). The market failure in this case is a negative\nexternality, which specifically can be identified as pollution caused by the health effects of PFAs.\nI hope this helps you catch up!\nSincerely,\nAn Econ 101 Student\n3\nCitations\nAmenabar, Teddy. “PFAS Chemicals to Be Phased out of Food Packaging.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nMarket failure is a common occurrence within economies, which happens when the market fails\nto maximize total surplus independently. Essentially, without government intervention, the\nmarket fails to produce the socially optimal quantity. This leads to an inefficient use of total\nsocial surplus. The four primary types of market failure include Externalities, Common\nResources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods.\nA negative externality signifies an unaccounted cost that is imposed by individuals or producers\non others. An example where we see this is CO2 emissions, which represent a negative\nexternality due to the social marginal cost incurred by burning gas, leading to negative\nenvironmental effects. Pollution, as a consequence, imposes societal costs on health and\nenvironmental well-being. These costs are typically not factored into producer pricing strategies,\nconstituting a negative externality, therefore producers tend to overproduce the good, as the\nactual production costs are understated. Government intervention, often in the form of taxes or\nquotas, is necessary to rectify such externalities. In the case of CO2 emissions, quotas are\npreferred over taxes due to the difficulty in precisely assessing the cost of each unit of gas\nproduced.\nA scenario which we can see this is Joe Biden’s initiative to encourage more Americans to use\nelectric vehicles. In order to make electric cars cheaper, he is planning on giving support and\nloans to mining companies so they can get the materials they need for batteries. Right now, there\nis not enough lithium for batteries because mining companies do not have the backing they need.\nThis is creating an artificial scarcity which causes electric car prices to go up. Joe Biden wants to\nfix this problem while also promoting the positive things that electric cars bring like helping the\nenvironment. We recognize the relation to market failure because we are not seeing nearly as\nmany electric cars as we should be in order to maximize social welfare. Biden’s initiative\nencourages a positive externality by promoting environmentally beneficial transportation.\nWe can see the market failure occurs when optimal outcomes without government intervention\nare not achieved. Joe Biden’s plan to strengthen the market for electric vehicles shows the point\nthat the shortage of battery materials such as lithium has led to rises in prices. Through backing\nthese mining companies, Biden will overcome this challenge and grow environmentally friendly\ntransportation.

      "essay": "Hello,\nI heard that you would like to know more about market failures. A market failure usually\nhappens because of a lack of government intervention, which causes the market to be inefficient.\nThis inefficiency could be overproduction, underproduction, or a slew of other problems (like\nmonopolies). The reason why it’s inefficient is that surplus is not maximized so while the market\nis in ‘equilibrium’ it doesn’t consider external costs(externalities).\nThere are two types of market failures: negative and positive externalities. There are\nmany types of externalities but the two classic ones are for cigarettes and vaccines for negative\nand positive respectively. The way to fix an externality is through government intervention, and\nis usually done through subsidies or taxes. One example of an externality are the two new Lyme\ndisease vaccines discussed in the NY Post. This is a positive externality, which is the benefit\nconsumers/producers give to society without return. A positive externality can be building better\nroads like what Michigan is doing or a good public school. The positive externality here is that if\npeople take the vaccine the risk of the disease is reduced and in cases like polio, the disease is\nwiped out. People taking vaccines protect their community from getting that same virus which is\na benefit not rewarded by a free market. It’s external because neither the consumer nor the\nproducer are receiving these benefits rather it’s society as a whole improving due to more\nvaccines in supply.\nHow is a good thing a market failure? As I said earlier, the benefits of vaccines are a\nbenfit that is not rewarded by a free market which doesn’t give incentive to producers to produce\nenough to get maximum benefit for society. In fact, we are seeing this problem arise now in the\nmeasles outbreak which is exacerbated by anti-vaxxers (Blum). In the free market for vaccines,\nthere are too few vaccines for the people who need them. Since we fail to account for the\npositive externality, we can’t maximize total surplus, the goal of the free market. To do so, we\nneed to give incentive to producers so that the supply curve shifts right and they make enough.\nFor a negative one we would need to disincentivize consumers so that the demand curve shifts\nleft and there's less in the market. With the vaccine, there is a gap between marginal private\nbenefit (free market demand) and marginal social benefit, the actual demand. Supply curve shifts\nshould be able to account for this gap and help correct the market and get rid of deadweight loss.\nThere is a simple solution to this market failure. Since we want producers to make more,\nwe can reduce their costs so that market efficient production costs are the same as before. The\nway to do this is through a per-unit subsidy which would shift the supply curve and meet it at the\nmarginal social cost.\nHopefully you learned more about market failures.

      "essay": "\nDear friend,\nIn this letter I hope to explain to you how a market failure occurs, as well as provide a realistic example to help alleviate any confusion.\nTo begin, a market failure occurs when, without any government or outside intervention, the market does not reach efficiency. This means that it does not maximize total surplus at that time. This could be caused by anything from an externality to a public good, to common resources or artificially scarce goods. An externality is an unintended external consequence or benefit caused by something, and this is the kind of market failure I will explain further in depth below.\nTo better explain how a market failure works, let me give you a real life example from recent news. In the New York Times on March 9th, reporter Andrew Jacobs wrote an article discussing the recent discoveries of microplastics in the human body. Microplastics are very small fragments of plastic that have been found all over the world as a result of the growing plastic industry and poor recycling practices. These microplastics have now even been discovered inside of the human body, including the lungs, blood, placenta, and brain (Jacobs). This synthetic material is very harmful inside the human body, and although little is known for certain about the health effects, research points to the possibility of it creating health problems such as cardiovascular complications and disease.\nThis problem surrounding microplastics and their negative health effects would be considered a negative externality due to the plastic industry. This is a negative externality because the harm from these microplastics (the health problems) is an unintended outcome of the development of plastics on an external group (everyone and everything), making it a negative externality.\n`\tOverall, the market is performing with this consequence added to it, and so this external cost is subtracted from the total surplus, reducing the total surplus. This makes the market fail because it is not maximizing total surplus, and is therefore not performing efficiently at its equilibrium point. On the graph this can be seen by the total external cost added to the supply curve (the producer’s marginal cost), creating a social marginal cost curve that consists of the producer marginal cost and external marginal cost together. The place where the demand curve intersects the social marginal cost curve is the efficient quantity, which is lower than the equilibrium quantity and priced more expensively, with a decrease in total surplus. This shows that the market failed. \nThe plastics industry is extremely useful in numerous ways. Whether it be for containers, single use items, pipes, or polyester, we utilize plastics daily and the benefits of them are not forgotten. That being said, the market is still failing in reality due to the negative externality seen in the microplastics being found in our bodies and their poor health effects.\nI hope this example helps to clear up any confusion surrounding market failure! Let me know if you have any questions. \n\nBest,\nVictoria \n\n\n498 words\n\n\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=2. \n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope you are doing well. Since market failure can be difficult to fully grasp, I thought I\nwould help explain it. Market failure occurs when the market, without any intervention, does not\nreach an efficient outcome when it is in equilibrium. The efficient outcome is when total surplus\nis maximized. There are several different examples that lead to market failure. However, today I\nthought I would explain negative externalities. A negative externality is an unaccounted cost that\na person or company imposes on others. To account for or internalize a negative externality, the\nexternal cost produced by the market should be laid on top of the supply curve. In other words, at\nequilibrium, supply is only the producer’s marginal cost. However, by adding the external cost to\nthe supply curve, the new supply curve is now the social marginal cost. To make it less abstract, I\nhave found an article from the New Y ork Times about Stanley cups. The article focuses on the\nunintended impacts of the Stanley tumbler. The product itself is meant to be reused and serves as\na better alternative to other plastic bottles, yet people have dozens of them, and researchers are\nworried they will soon become useless. Additionally, Stanley Cup production requires stainless\nsteel as one of its inputs. The production of stainless steel cups pollutes the environment and\nrelies on dirty fossil fuels. As a consequence, Stanley cup production affects not only the\nproducers or consumers in the market but also bystanders across the world who breathe in\npolluted air. So, now, imagine a graph that shows the equilibrium outcome; supply and demand\nonly account for the producer and consumer’s marginal cost and marginal benefit, respectively.\nY et, a third party, those who breathe in contaminated air, are also facing consequences from the\nproduction of Stanley cups. By adding this external cost on top of the supply curve, or the\nproducer’s marginal cost, the market now internalizes the previously unaccounted-for\nconsequence. At this new intersection, between demand, or social marginal benefit, and supply,\nsocial marginal cost, the quantity exchanged lowers and price rises. At equilibrium, there is total\nsurplus that is consumer surplus, the area beneath the demand curve and above the market price,\nadded to producer surplus, the area above the supply curve and below the market price. Y et, there\nis also negative surplus, or deadweight loss, that is equal to half of the difference between prices\nin the efficient outcome versus equilibrium and the difference in quantity. Therefore, equilibrium\ncannot be the efficient outcome since total surplus is not maximized, and there is overproduction\nof the good.\nHope that helps!\nSincerely,\nA Friend.\nWork Cited:\nTabuchi, Hiroko. “Is There a Climate Cost to Collecting Climate-Friendly Stuff, like Mugs?”\nThe New Y ork Times, The New Y ork Times, 9 Feb. 2024,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/climate/stanley-mug-sustainability.html.\nWord Count: 443",

      "essay": "Subject: Understanding Market Failure: A Practical Example\nHey John,\nI hope you're doing okay with everything going on.\nSo right now we’re just going over market failure. To break down market failure for you\nit’s a concept that's really important to understand because it helps us see where the free market\nsystem doesn't always work as efficiently as we'd like. Market failure usually occurs when the\nallocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, leading to negative outcomes\nfor society. This can happen for various reasons, like when there are externalities, common\nresources, public goods, or artificially scarce goods involved. All these things can lead to market\nfailures and affect the market negatively, leading it out of equilibrium.\nTo make this concept clearer and to just give you a real word example of what I'm talking\nabout, let's look at an article I found in The New Y ork Times titled \"Many Laws to Protect\nSharks Have Backfired, Researchers Find,\" published on January 11, 2024. I’ll leave a link for\nyou to read the article at the end of this email.\nNow, in this article, the authors discuss how efforts to protect sharks have actually led to\nunintended consequences, which is a classic example of market failure. Market failure typically\noccurs when there is a positive or negative externality on the market that leads there to be either\nexcess cost or excess benefit. In this case it is an excess cost. Specifically, it highlights the issue\nof unsustainable fishing practices driven by high demand for shark meat and fins, which has\nendangered shark populations.\nSo, how does this relate to the concept of market failure and the terms we've learned in\nclass? To be more specific it relates to the issue of Common Resource. Sharks are considered\ncommon resources because they exist in international waters and are not owned by any\nindividual or entity. However, due to the high demand for shark fins and meat, fishermen engage\nin unsustainable fishing practices, leading to overfishing and endangerment of shark populations.\nThe sharks, unable to breed fast enough to cover for this overfishing, eventually begin to die out.\nThe negative environmental impact of depleting shark populations, such as disrupting\nmarine ecosystems and endangering other species, is not reflected in the market price of shark\nproducts. As a result, fishermen and consumers do not bear the full cost of their actions, leading\nto an inefficient allocation of resources and negative outcomes for society as a whole. This\nfailure to internalize the external costs associated with overfishing demonstrates a clear example\nof market failure, where the market fails to allocate resources efficiently and leads to detrimental\nconsequences for both the environment and society.\nBy understanding this example, you can see how market failure can occur even when\nthere are regulations in place. It's essential to consider the broader implications of economic\ndecisions and policies to avoid unintended consequences.\nBest,\nOreoluwa Sokunbi\nWord count: 493",

      "essay": "Hello,\nMarket failure occurs when absent any outside intervention, including government intervention,\nthe market doesn’t reach efficiency. The market doesn’t maximize total surplus, even in\nequilibrium.\nMarket failures often occur when externalities are present. Externalities are added benefits or\ncosts to a third party outside of the market. A third party is outside of the group of\ndecision-makers in the market (producers and consumers) yet is impacted by decisions. The\nmarket does not account for such externalities in equilibrium, therefore failing to be efficient.\nAn example of market failure in the real world is the PFAS chemical factory in North Carolina.\nThe factory produces PFAS chemicals which are used in water and grease resistant products. The\nmarket for PFAS chemicals includes the producers (the factory owners) and the consumers\n(people and corporations buying the chemicals). However, a United Nations panel recently\nreported that chemical waste has previously been dumped into the river next to the factory. This\npollution has harmed those living along the river since PFAS chemicals accumulate in the\nenvironment, human and animal blood, and organs. This accumulation causes water\ncontamination and harms human health (Tabuchi, 2024). The pollution is therefore a negative\nexternality since it is harming a third party (people along the river).\nThe companies producing the chemicals have denied the harm caused by the chemicals and\nrefused to take accountability for their damage, despite reports it exists. The companies are\ntherefore not accounting for the additional cost of their product on society. Total surplus is then\nnot maximized at equilibrium. There will be deadweight loss associated with the market\nequilibrium.\nSocial marginal cost is the total marginal cost to society and is made up of producer marginal\ncost, which is accounted for in equilibrium, combined with external marginal cost, which in this\ncase is the cost of pollution on people living along the river. The efficient quantity in a market\nthat has an externality is where social marginal benefit (which in this case is equal to the\nconsumer’s marginal benefit) intersects the social marginal cost. In this case, this would be\nwhere the marginal benefit for the factory owners intersects the cost to buyers of the PFAS\nchemicals added to the cost to people living along the river. In the case of a positive externality,\nwhere a third party is benefiting from the market, the social marginal benefit is equal to the\nconsumer's marginal benefit added to the external marginal benefit.\nWith a negative externality, the market equilibrium results in too many units of the good\ncompared to the efficient level while a market with a positive externality has too few units of a\ngood at equilibrium compared to the efficient level. Here, more chemicals will be produced than\nis efficient. To account for the effects of pollution, production of chemicals should be lower. The\nefficient quantity of chemicals produced may not be zero since there is still benefit to society\n(through benefit going to producers and consumers).\nI hope this helps,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 499\nLink to article:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/climate/pfas-forever-chemicals-north-carolina.html?search\nResultPosition=14\nReferences\nTabuchi, H.

      "essay": "Dear Jamie,\n\nI hope everything is going well at home. I'm here to help with your Economics 101 problems. You asked about market failure, and I think I have a perfect example to help you understand the concept. Market failure refers to situations where the market is not working perfectly at equilibrium. The effects of market failure is too much or too little production or consumption of a particular good or service, compared to what is considered optimal or when the market is at equilibrium. One example of an article in The Washington Post that discusses the Biden administration’s approach to fossil fuel permits and natural gas “Biden’s mixed signals on natural gas will only undermine his climate plan”. This situation is an example of market failure due to externalities.\nExternalities are costs or benefits that affect people not directly involved in the production or consumption of a good or service. In the case of this article with pollution, that includes me and you. When the market fails to account for these external costs or benefits, the result is an inefficient outcome. In the case of this article, the negative externality is environmental damage from fossil fuel fracking and usage, which includes air and water pollution and huge contribution to global warming and climate change.\nThe fossil fuel industry is extremely lucrative generating billions in revenue every year. But the oil fracking companies are not burdened with cleaning up their pollution.  Instead, societies and governments worldwide are left to handle the problems creating a negative externality. This market failure results in more production and consumption of fossil fuels than what would be optimal if all costs were considered. Countermeasures such as carbon taxes and the introduction of clean energy solutions aim to correct this failure by internalizing the external costs so that producers and consumers must consider the full social cost in their decisions. However fossil fuels are still the most common type of energy because of its low cost and easy access. . \nMarket failures in these cases typically require governmental intervention to achieve a more efficient and proper allocation of resources. If it were not for government intervention, these oil fracking companies would most likely continue to mine oil disregarding the effect on the environment as it is extremely profitable.  I hope this example helps explain market failure for you. Once again, I hope all is well. Let me know if you need any more help understanding these concepts.

      "essay": "Hello! I see that you have missed out on learning about market failure in our economy. Will\nwill gladly provide you with the key points, concepts, and examples of what market failure is. To\nstart, you must know that market failure is a term that describes situations where the market not\nbothered by the government can’t successfully distribute resources and goods to the public.\nSome key concepts that are most likely to cause market failure are ones like asymmetric\ninformation, imperfect competition, externalities, and public goods in general.\nWhen market failure occurs, many times the government must intervene and apply some\nregulations as a nudge to make things better for everyone.One example of what the government\nmight come in and do is impose taxes or subsidies on different groups to encourage positive\ndistribution. They could impose a tax on carbon emissions in order to discourage them from what\ntheir doing that is causing a negative externality. On the other hand, they could impose a subsidy\non development of renewable energy production. The government could also enforce laws that\nhinder and restrict monopolies and oligopolies. This is called antitrust laws and they stop\ncompanies from harassing smaller ones in their field; they remove barriers that these monopolies\nhave up which ensures more equal competition.\nHere I have an example for you of this negative externality that is a suspect of causing market\nfailure. This is from the New Y ork Times in January, this year, when they published information\non how climate change is negatively affecting many third party groups that have no control of\nthe problem. This article is called ‘We’re All Climate Economists Now’ and it states that “there’s\nplenty of evidence that on the heels of the hottest year in recorded history, climate is in the\nspotlight” (Depilis). Apparently, between “higher temperatures on factory productivity”,\nelectricity grids absorbing more renewable energy, and the temperature rising so much that more\nand more wildfires continue to ignite, it is clear that business done between these energy\ncompanies and the plant owners cause a deficit to people all over that area. They are being taxed\nand can not do anything about it. This also causes externality with the people being negatively\naffected by the excess carbon that is released into the air.\nWith this example and the key concepts and points that I pointed out, I hope you can now be\nconfident that you're knowledgeable about market failure. Remember that it can transpire\nthrough many different factors; a main one is externalities, however. It is imperative to try and\nsteer clear of market failures as a population by striving for the right balance, but most of the\ntime this is such a large exchange between two parties, disadvantages for people can get way out\nof control.\nSincerely,\nY our Peer\nWord Count: 465 words\nCitations\nDepillis, Lydia. “‘We’re All Climate Economists Now.’” The New York Times, The New Y ork\naaaa Times, 23 Jan. 2024,\naaaaaaawww.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/business/economy/climate-change-economics.html",

Although there are many different kinds of market failures\nwithin a market such as positive and negative externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods, today we are going to focus specifically on negative externalities. A\nnegative externality in terms of market failure is an uncompensated cost that an unrelated\nindividual or firm imposes on others outside of the relevant market, otherwise known as an\n“external cost.” To help visualize that better, imagine this: Consumers and producers are buying\nand selling goods and services in the market like usual. Only this time, their actions of\nconsuming and producing certain goods and services are negatively harming some unrelated\nthird party completely separate from the relevant market. To help you better understand this\nfrom a real-world perspective, I chose an article from the Washington Post on a specific negative\nexternality currently being imposed on the US by Canada. The article, (Brown, Matthew. “US,\nCanada and indigenous groups announce proposal to address cross-border mining pollution.” The\nWashington Post, 11 March 2024), discusses the active issue of cross-border US water pollution\ncaused by coal mining from the Canadian province of British Columbia. For some context,\npollution from mining coal in British Columbia’s Elk V alley is seeping into Lake Koocanusa, a\nreservoir in British Columbia and Montana, which then flows into US Rivers, contaminating the\nfish, insects, birds and any other organisms living within the ecosystem with high amounts of\nharmful selenium(Brown 1). In this particular case, the occurring market failure is the\nirresponsible, over-mining of Canada’s British Columbia coal mines, not only polluting US\nwaters, but harming the associated US markets as well, such as the markets for fresh\ndrinking-water and fishing. This type of market failure is classified as a negative externality, as\nmining coal from Canadian coal mines is unrelatedly causing pollution to flow into US Rivers, a\ntotally unrelated party. In terms more “market-failure-friendly”, British Columbia’s coal mining\nmarket is imposing an uncompensated cost of pollution onto totally unrelated US waters, along\nwith negatively affecting the related US markets and preventing them from reaching or operating\nat full efficiency, thus resulting in a market failure from a negative externality.\nSincerely,\nY our friend\nWorks Cited\nBrown, Matthew. “US, Canada and indigenous groups announce proposal to address\ncross-border mining pollution.” The Washington Post, 11 March 2024\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/11/mining-pollution-us-canada-tribes-agree\nment/7d20f834-dfc9-11ee-95aa-7384336086f3_story.html\nWord Count: 430",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope that you are doing well despite everything that has been going on. I understand\nthat you are struggling with the concept of market failure, especially as discussed in our Econ\n101 class. I found a relevant article that I thought would help clarify the concept to you. In the\nOregon Capitol Chronicle article, a group of northeastern Oregon residents have filed lawsuits\nagainst the Port of Morrow and a few businesses for developing contamination in their drinking\nwater. The contaminated water has, according to the article, caused various severe health\nimplications to thousands of people in the area. Additionally, the article explains how the citizens\nfiled a lawsuit asserting that their well water was unusable after being exposed to chemicals..\nUnder market failure, a situation arises where the allocation of goods and services by a free\nmarket is not eﬃcient. As a result, the over or under-allocation of resources aﬀects the quality\nand quantity of the goods and services produced. In the article, the pollution of the drinking\nwater is a typical example of a negative externality that reveals market failure. A common type of\nmarket failure is an externality, defined as that production or consumption of a good or service\nthat imposes costs or benefits on a third party not involved in the market exchange. In this case,\nthe residents aﬀected by the drinking water are not part of the businesses undertaking the\nagricultural activities that cause the contamination. They cannot sue or force the businesses to\naddress the environmental issue. Hence, it becomes a negative externality as the businesses have\nno incentives to clean up their environment. The residents sued the businesses to externalize their\nlack of incentives to clean up the environmental implications of their activities. Despite the state\ncreating regulations and imposing fines on the businesses, they continued with their activities\nwithout any form of compensation to the aﬀected residents. The law that was meant to have the\nmarket factor in the externalities failed to work, and sued the businesses became the only sound\nsolution. To solve market failure, the government is expected to intervene in the market and\nenforce the laws that will make the businesses internalize the costs of their activities. By filing a\nlawsuit, the residents are agitating for an equally critical collective action to ensure that no one is\naﬀected by such types of market failures. I hope that the above information helps you understand\nmarket failure.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI heard you've been struggling with understanding the concept of market failure, so here's\na quick explanation of market failure and the concepts that contribute to it. A market failure\noccurs when, without government intervention, the market fails to reach the efficient outcome of\nmaximizing total surplus.Different types of goods can contribute to market failures. Public goods\nare freely accessible to all, reducing the incentive for private production and often necessitating\ngovernment intervention. Likewise, common resources, while free, are limited, leading\nconsumers to use them more extensively due to concerns about depletion. Both positive and\nnegative externalities can also contribute to market failure. A negative externality causes a\nmarket failure because it does not account for the social marginal cost incurred. For example,\npollution is a negative externality because it affects a third party, in this case the neighboring\ncommunities, this cost is not accounted for in the equilibrium. In the case of a positive\nexternality, the market is not accounting for all the benefits in the decision it makes, meaning that\nthe efficient outcome is not the same as the market outcome. A positive externality is a form of\nmarket failure that occurs when a third party benefits as a result of an indirect effect of a\ntransaction by another party. A market failure occurs because the equilibrium results in too few\nunits of the good compared to the efficient level. In order to maximize total surplus in a market\nexperiencing a positive externality we need to account for the external benefit. By accounting for\nthe external marginal benefit and combining it with the consumer marginal benefit we are able to\ndraw the social marginal benefit, creating a curve to the right of the demand curve. In the case of\nParadise V alley, a desert in central Arizona, large palatial houses are being built. This drives the\nvalues of property in the area up and the property owners are receiving an external benefit as a\nresult of the increase in neighboring property. The market as it stands does not account for this\nextra benefit the current homeowners receive in the form of increased property value. This extra\nbenefit along with the marginal benefit the consumer receives creates our Social marginal benefit\ncurve. In this instance, since there's no negative externality, supply is also the social marginal\ncost. The efficient outcome occurs where the social marginal benefit and the supply curve\nintersect. The deadweight loss is formed within the triangle between where the market quantity\nintersects the consumers MB and the Social marginal benefit, and where social Marginal Benefit\ncrosses the supply curve. Since any unit beyond the market equilibrium quantity has to get\nsubsidized in order for it to be produced, we need to subsidize the purchase of property to build\npalatial houses. The subsidy imposed should equal the external marginal benefit in order to\nachieve the efficient outcome.\nWord count:482/500\nWorks cited\nFlint, J. (2024).

      "essay": "From: Your Econ Friend\nSubject: Understanding Market Failure\nDear Friend, \nI hope this email finds you well despite the family emergency you are currently dealing with back home.  I understand that you're trying to keep up with the Econ 101 coursework despite everything going on. Don't worry, you have only missed the topic of market failure, and luckily you have a good friend who will try to explain the concept to you in this email. \nMarket failure happens when a free market doesn't allocate goods and services efficiently. This leads to an outcome where resources are not allocated optimally from the perspective of society as a whole. In simpler terms, market failure occurs when an individual or a company pursues their own interests or benefits in a way that unintentionally harms or negatively impacts the broader economy, society, or environment. To help you understand this better, I found an article that gives a specific example. It is titled \"North Carolina 'Forever Chemical' Plant Violates Human Rights, U.N. Panel Says\" by Hiroko Tabuchi, published on February 27, 2024, in The New York Times. Here's the link to the article: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/climate/pfas-forever-chemicals-north-carolina.html?searchResultPosition=10.\nThe article talks about a chemical plant located on the Cape Fear River in North Carolina that is causing tremendous amounts of pollution. For over four decades, this plant has been dropping contaminated wastewater into the river, making the water unsafe to drink for around a 100-mile stretch. This situation exemplifies market failure, specifically due to negative externalities.\nExternalities are a type of market failure. There are two kinds of externalities positive and negative, however, in this article we clearly see a negative externality.  Negative externalities are unintended side effects of economic activities that affect parties not directly involved in the transaction. In this case, the chemical plant's pollution negatively impacts the surrounding community and the environment. While the plant benefits from its operations, such as producing vital technologies and generating profits, it doesn't bear the full cost of the pollution it creates.\nThe costs, including health risks and environmental damage, are externalized to the residents along the river and the broader ecosystem. Despite being aware of the toxic impacts of the chemicals it produces, the company prioritizes its profits and expansion plans over the well-being of the community. This lack of consideration for the negative externalities leads to overproduction and inefficient resource allocation.\nIn summary, the article vividly illustrates how market failure manifests through negative externalities, where the actions of the chemical plant result in harmful consequences for society and the environment, without the plant being held accountable for these costs. \nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of market failure for you. If you have more questions or need help, let me know. We're here to help during this tough time. \nRegards,\nYour friend\nWord Count: 470\nNewman, Matthew. \"In North Carolina, 'Forever Chemicals' Are Found in Water.\" The New York Times, 27 Feb. 2024,\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope you're doing okay given the circumstances. I understand keeping up with Econ 101 while handling family matters can be challenging, so I'm glad to help clarify the concept of market failure for you. It's crucial to understand how markets can sometimes lead to inefficient outcomes that necessitate government intervention.\nMarket failure takes place when a free market, absent of any form of intervention, fails to allocate goods and services efficiently. The market fails to maximize the total surplus even when the market has reached equilibrium. There are several situations that can cause a market failure, including externalities, public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods. Personally, I think externalities are the most straightforward examples of understanding market failure. There are two types of externalities: negative and positive. A negative externality is an uncompensated external cost that an individual or company imposes on others. A positive externality is an external benefit that an individual or company confers on others without receiving any compensation. Both forms of externalities create a cost or benefit that is not accounted for in the market price. It is important to know that the market always overproduces negative externalities and underproduces positive externalities. Since the equilibrium is not guaranteed to be the most efficient result, we need to utilize marginal analysis to see how the market maximizes total net gain where marginal benefit intersects marginal cost.\nTo explain market failure more concretely, I want to use a recent article in The Wall Street Journal titled \"Electric Cars Emit More Particulate Pollution\" which offers a compelling illustration of market failure in the form of negative externality. Intending to reduce air pollution, the push for electric vehicles in California has potentially increased particulate pollution because EVs wear down tires faster than their gasoline counterparts due to their heavy weight. Despite being advertised as “zero-emissions vehicles,” tire wear contributes significantly to particulate pollution.\nThis is an example of a market failure caused by negative externality. In the market of electric vehicles, people fail to account for the particulate pollution resulting from EVs’ frequent tire wear. This is an external cost created by EV companies and imposed on the third party, which in this case is the environment or our earth. The oversight of this pollution results in the market’s failure to account for the external cost, which is part of the social marginal cost. Pollution exists as it is the cheapest way to deal with waste and the market’s inability to see the full social costs suggests a need for government intervention to deal with the inefficiency.\nThis case is a vivid of how a negative externality can cause a market failure. It is important to recognize these unintentional consequences and costs in the market. Take care and best wishes to your family during this time.\n",

      "essay": "Writing Assignment 3: Market Failure\nHello friend! I hope whatever you are dealing with right now isn’t taking that big of a toll on you. Recently, we started talking about market failure (which I know you’re a little confused about), so let me explain it to you. Market failure is “a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market absent any intervention” (Drury, 2024).  There's a way that you can measure this. First, you should identify the total surplus at the market equilibrium. Next, you should identify the efficient outcome, which is the maximum total surplus. Then finally you should measure the difference, giving you the measure of the market failure. Some big examples of market failure are monopolies, oligopolies, externalities, common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. To help you better understand market failure, I’m going to use a real-life example of externalities.\nAn externality is either an adverse or beneficial consequence that an individual or firm imposes on others without receiving any compensation. This is why there are negative or positive externalities because it can either help others or hurt others. We’ll be looking at the article Lithium Liabilities: The Untold Hazard of the Push for More American Lithium Mines. In this article, Nyle Penning (a water scientist) talks about the impact of lithium mining on water resources in places like Silver Peak, Nevada. Nyle found from his research that there has been a decrease in groundwater near the lithium mines, which have been pumping a lot of water from it. Looking at other lithium mines, it appears also to be the same case: a decline in groundwater. With U.S. and foreign companies wanting to continue to produce lithium mines because of how profitable they are, these projects plan to draw water from stressed sources like the Colorado River. Although there is clear evidence to back up that lithium mines are drawing and taking away our freshwater, these mining companies deny any notable impact on our freshwater sources.\nAlthough it is never explicitly said here, this is an example of a market failure in the form of a negative externality. The market failure is the impact of the lithium mines (whether the existing ones or the new ones) that cause there to be less freshwater due to the lithium mines using a lot of it. Taking away our freshwater hurts society because humans use it for everyday activities like bathing, cooking, and drinking. Freshwater is where many of the fish we eat and hunt are located, so this will hurt the fishing market and industry as well as the home life and basic needs of humans. As I said earlier this is a market failure in the form of an externality, but there are many other types of market failure, many in the world that might not be “econ-related”.\nWord Count: 474\n\nLink to Cite: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/01/26/lithium-mining-affects-water-supply/72344587007/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited\nDrury, A.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hear that you have been wanting to learn more about market failure. T o provide\nbackground, market failure is the inefficient allocation of goods/services in the market, caused\nby either a positive or negative externality. Externalities occur when a good or service’s price\nequilibrium doesn’t match the accurate costs or benefits associated with it. Positive externalities\nare benefits that someone gives others without receiving compensation for it, like vaccinations,\neducation, or scientific research. The market equilibrium represents fewer units of the good than\nthe efficient level. Positive externalities can be resolved by providing a subsidy (equal to the\nexternal marginal benefit), shifting the demand curve (consumer marginal benefit) to meet the\nsocial marginal benefit. Negative externalities are costs that someone gives others that are\nuncompensated, like pollution, secondhand smoke, or traffic congestion. The market equilibrium\nrepresents more units of the good than the efficient level. Negative externalities can be resolved\nby enacting a tax (equal to the external marginal cost), which shifts the supply curve (producer\nmarginal cost) left to meet the social marginal cost.\nEfficiency can be reached by either directly addressing the externality or the market for\nthe good/service. The government can address the externality (ex. pollution) by enacting\nenvironmental standards, establishing emissions taxes (Pigouvian tax), or creating tradable\nemission permits: essentially limiting the quantity of externality emitted by increasing the cost of\nemissions. The government can also target the market for goods/services (ex. leather) through\nenvironmental standards, Pigouvian taxes, or production quotas, again, limiting the quantity of\nthe goods/services produced. Additionally, by Coase's Theorem, market failure can be resolved\nif the transaction costs are relatively low.\nNo example provides a better understanding than Hiroko T abuchi’s NYTimes article\nabout the recent methane emission finding. T abuchi discusses the human-caused methane gas\nemissions in the atmosphere, finding that oil and gas producers in major oil fields across the US\nare emitting three times as much gas as previously estimated. The abundance of released\nmethane is a form of market failure—a negative externality—with the potential to increase the\nplanet’s temperature more than 80 times as much as the same amount of CO2. It also causes\nside effects that many people are not a part of, but are impacted by, like the rise in temperatures\ncausing higher sea levels, more devastating storms and droughts, and a greater loss of\nbiodiversity. As human-caused methane gas release increases, these consequences will only\nworsen as people will need to move further inland, rebuild after natural disasters, and suffer\nagricultural losses associated with the loss of biodiversity.\nGovernments can best limit emissions by directly targeting the externality, but since\nmethane emission is virtually impossible to measure or quantify, they need to use alternative\nways to reduce this negative externality. For example, enacting environmental standards,\nemissions taxes, or tradable emissions permits can reduce negative externalities.\nI hope this email cleared up the topic of market failure for you!\nBest,\nYour friend\nWord count: 490",

However, it is important to first know what this economic term means. Market failure\nessentially “occurs when, absent any intervention (even government intervention), the market\nfails to reach the efficient outcome (i.e. the market does not maximize total surplus) even in\nequilibrium” (Dudley, 2024). Within this, there are three main causes of market failure that\nwe’ve talked about in this course: externalities, types of goods, and consumer choice, all of\nwhich cause inefficiencies.\nA real-world example of a specific market failure would be an article called U.S. Gas\nProducers Are Racing to Sell to Asia. And Mexico Is Key, from the New Y ork Times, is an\nexcellent example of this. In summary, in this article, the author Max Bearak explains how the\nfossil fuel industry in the U.S. will be able to sell gas to Asia more efficiently by taking a\nshortcut in Mexico, as a previous canal can no longer be used, causing a decrease in gas being\nexported, resulting in the industry building more terminals (Bearak, 2024). However, there has\nbeen a pause in the construction of such a terminal due to the Biden administration debating the\nimpacts it will have on the environment, specifically global warming and climate change\n(Bearak, 2024).\nWith this background information, it is presented that there is a negative externality.\nWhen talking about externalities, it is important to keep in mind that there are both positive and\nnegative externalities. However, in this particular article, there is a negative externality, which\nmeans there is “an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Also known\nas an external cost” (Dudley, 2024) that causes market failure. The market failure presented in\nthis article is climate change due to the price of these projects in the fossil fuel industry, which is\ncausing gases to be released into the air, causing a harmful effect on an unrelated third party,\nwhich in this case would be people all around the world, which is something that isn’t taken into\nconsideration in the market price of the industry, which causes it to be classified as a negative\nexternality of market failure.\nOverall, I hope this email has helped you understand what market failure is and the\ngeneral concept of it, including how the article from New Y ork Times that is used as an example\nclarifies not only what negative externalities are but specifically leads to market failure.\nBibliography\nDudley, Mitchell. “Externalities”, 2024\nBearak, M.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope this email finds you well and that I am able to clear up any confusion you may have about\nmarket failure. First, market failure occurs when, absent of any intervention (even government\nintervention), the market fails to reach the efficient outcome (the market does not maximize total\nsurplus) even in equilibrium (Dudley). An example of a market failure is an externality. An\nexternality is an unintended cost or benefit that affects a third party who did not intend to\nundertake the cost or benefit. When there is a cost imposed on others, it is a negative externality,\nand when there is a benefit imposed on others, it is a positive externality. An example that was\ngiven in class of an externality involved the look of a neighbors yard in a neighborhood. The\nstate of the yard creates effects for more than just the homeowner and the yard itself. If the yard\nis well maintained then it can create a positive externality such as a boost in the mood of other\nneighbors. If the yard is poorly maintained then it can create a negative externality such as a\ndecrease in the value of surrounding homes because less people will want to live by a home that\ndoes not look pleasing.\nI have also found a news article that I believe will help me explain the concept of market failure\nto you. In the article “Electric Cars Emit More Particulate Pollution”, the writer discusses how\nCalifornia plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 to reduce particulate\nemissions produced by cars. The article explains how electrical cars may lead to more particulate\npollution than gasoline-powered cars because electrical cars are heavier, which leads to them\nproducing more tire-wear emissions. The market failure in this scenario is the miscalculated\npollution created by electrical vehicles which creates a negative externality for people with heart\nand lung issues. These individuals may have to undertake health expenses caused by the increase\nin particulate emissions from electric vehicles.

      "essay": "To my dearest friend,\nI hope all is well. I was told that you are having problems understanding what market failure is in\nyour current economics course. Luckily for you, I actually just finished that unit and am here to\nhelp you comprehend it.\nTo start off, let’s define market failure. It is when markets don’t do a good job at giving people\nwhat they need or want, resulting in problems or unfair situations.\nMarket failure isn’t just a plain definition. There are key concepts that you need to understand\nand remember to fully define it.\nTo start off, externalities. There are two types of externalities - negative and positive. A negative\nexternality is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others (ex: pollution).\nA positive externality is a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others when receiving\ncompensation (ex: vaccines).\nNext, we have types of goods. Goods can be categorized in four categories: private goods,\ncommon resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods. When thinking of types of goods,\nthe first thing to ask yourself is whether they are excludable and/or rivals in consumption. Firstly,\nprivate goods are excludable and rivals in consumption. Think of food items - not everyone can\nafford them and not everyone can buy them because there is a limited amount. Secondly,\ncommon resources. These types of goods are rivals in consumption, but are non-excludable.\nThink of fishing for this one. When you go fishing you’re trying to catch fish, and so is the\nperson next to you. That makes it a rival in consumption. Although, it is non-excludable because\nyou aren’t paying a price for it, therefore everyone can afford it.\nThirdly, artificially scarce goods. These types of goods are non-rivals in consumption and\nexcludable. Think of a streaming media like netflix. Netflix is excludable because not everyone\ncan afford it, but everyone who has it can watch it at the same time, making it a non-rival in\nconsumption.\nFourthly and lastly, public goods. These types of goods are non-rivals in consumption and\nnon-excludable. A public good could be something like snow removal. Snow removal is done on\nthe streets so whether you paid for it or not, you’re technically still getting it.\nNow that I’ve defined everything for you, I wanted to go over an article that I thought could put\neverything into perspective. I chose the article “Climate Change Has Hit Home Insurance. Is\nHealth Insurance Next?” This article talks about the impact of climate change on the insurance\nindustry, focusing on how extreme weather events are making health and home insurance more\nexpensive to obtain. The market failure identified is the insurance sector's difficulty in accurately\npricing the increased risks due to climate change. This would be categorized as a negative\nexternality because it talks about how climate change creates additional costs for the insurance\nworld who aren't contributing to the problem.\nI hope this helped a bit and I wish you look in your studies.\nSources:\nY usuf Khan. (2024). Climate change has hit home insurance, is health insurance next?

You haven’t missed much in class, the only major concept we’ve covered is market failure, but it’s pretty complex. The main thing with market failure is that its all about total surplus. Market failure occurs when the market does not generate as much total surplus as possible due to an externality. There are two types of externalities, positive or negative. A positive externality is a benefit someone receives without having to pay any sort of compensation. An example of this would be a well-maintained front yard, because someone will get the pleasure of looking at it, while not having to take care of it. A negative externality is a cost someone gets imposed upon them, without any compensation. An example of this would be pollution. We can see how externalities cause reductions in total surplus by using a supply and demand graph. In this graph, our supply is the producer’s marginal cost, and the demand is the consumer’s marginal benefit. When the graph is at equilibrium, total surplus is maximized. However, when a negative externality occurs, external cost is added to the producer marginal cost, which shifts the supply curve to the left, and creates a triangle of deadweight loss. Similarly, when a positive externality occurs, external benefit is added to the consumer marginal benefit, which shifts the demand curve to the right, and as a result creates a triangle of deadweight loss.\nMarket failure occurs so commonly in our everyday life. In fact, I was just reading about an example of market failure in the news. Recently in the Klamath river in Oregon, thousands of salmon died because of a “gas bubble disease”. The river is currently undergoing a large dam removal project, but when they changed the water pressure, it caused thousands of fish to unfortunately pass. In this instance, a negative externality occurred, since the California department of fish and wildlife is having their salmon population replacement program hindered by this pollution. They are being affected by this gas bubble disease, and as of right now, have no compensation for the thousands of salmon that died. Let me know if you need any more help, and I hope to see you soon/\n\nSincerely,\nSam Harvey\n\nWord Count: 410\n\nArticle Link: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/05/salmon-klamath-river-dam-removal-project\n",

      "essay": "To: Classmate in Econ 101\nFrom: A friend from the class\nHey there! As previously agreed, I’m writing you this email to help you catch up with\nsome course material we covered while you were away addressing your family emergency.\nDuring your absence, our class went over the idea of a market failure which occurs when absent\nany intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome even in equilibrium. In other\nwords, when we say that the market fails it is simply unable to attain a maximized total surplus\non its own, without any outside intervention. Typically, this trend occurs in markets where\nexternalities, public goods, common resources, and artificially scarce goods are involved. While\nthe way we demonstrate market failure will look different for each abovementioned case, I’ll\nnarrow down my focus on the market failure with externality, because, in my opinion, it is the\none that is seen most often and is the easiest to understand. Luckily, I’ve recently found an\ninteresting article that I think will give you a better grasp of the concept. Throughout it, the\nauthor argues that “the extreme droughts all around the Global South hindered the countries’\nhydroelectric production capabilities and as a result, they increased their consumption of fossil\nfuels for electricity generation as a strategy to resolve the energy deficit created by the problems\nin the hydroelectric sector” (Petroni). From this excerpt, you can essentially draw out that while\nthe producers undertook an economically rational decision to increase the usage of fossil fuels to\ncompensate for the energy that was not delivered by the hydropower industry, their action will,\nunfortunately, lead to greater air pollution levels and ultimately impact the third party that is not\neven a part of the Global South manufacturers’ market. As such, this is a clear example of the\nmarket failure resulting from the negative externality that imposes an uncompensated, or external\ncost on a part of the society who is not even a part of the examined market.\nUltimately, with the example mentioned above, you can see that the way negative\nexternality leads to a market failure is that it imposes an unintended cost on a third party and\ndecreases the market’s efficiency. Particularly, when we draw the effect caused by the negative\nexternality (a total external cost drawn above the supply curve as a rectangle) in our market\nmodel, we can notice that at the market equilibrium quantity, the market is, in fact, inefficient\nbecause there is a negative total surplus present there, which we need to combine with the\npositive total surplus to get our real total surplus at that precise quantity. Instead, what ends up as\nan efficient quantity where society’s total surplus is maximized is a point where the social\nmarginal cost (Producer’s MC + Total External Cost) intersects the social marginal benefit\n(Consumer’s MB) which interestingly is not the market equilibrium quantity. Thus, the market\nfailure creates an entirely new point where the market is considered to be efficient.

      "essay": "Hi!\nI hope all is well with your family. I would be happy to help explain market failure to you and\nget you back on track for class!\nMarket failure occurs when, absent from intervention, like the government imposing a quota, the\nmarket fails to reach the efficient outcome. As a refresher, the efficient outcome is when the\nmarket is able to maximize its total surplus. Remember that efficiency is not always at\nequilibrium.\nMarket failure can occur in a few different forms. However in class we have only covered a few\nof these so far. Market failure can occur from externalities as well as from types of goods,\nincluding common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nTo help you understand market failure, I thought I would dive deeper into an example of an\nexternality. Externalities can be positive or negative. They are positive when an individual or\nfirm imposes an uncompensated benefit on others; we call this an external benefit. Externalities\nare negative when an individual or firm imposes an uncompensated cost on others; we call this\nan external cost.\nTo clearly illustrate what market failure is, through an externality, I recommend looking at a\nreal-world example through the New Y ork Times article “Anxiety, Mood Swings and Sleepless\nNights: Life Near a Bitcoin Mine.” To summarize, the article brings to light the negative\nexternality associated with the noise produced by a Bitcoin mine in Arkansas as it imposes\nuncompensated costs on its neighboring community (Dance, 2024).\nAn example of a negative externality in the article is the quotation, “Blaming the operation for\nvarious health problems, including increased blood pressure, anxiety, difficulty sleeping and\nmood swings” (Dance, 2024). From this, we can identify that the Bitcoin mine is increasing\nhealthcare costs for the involved party, the neighbors.\nFurthermore, we can also identify a negative externality in the quotation, “The mine has\ndepressed property values. “Who would want to purchase property near the noisy site?”” (Dance,\n2024). We can pinpoint the fact that the noise that the mine is producing is decreasing the value\nof the neighbor's property, diminishing their ability to sell their homes at their original value and\nmove away from the mine.\nIt is evident that there has been an external cost generated from the Bitcoin mine, decreasing the\ncommunity's quality of life, with some residents describing their lives as “hell” since the mine\noperation began (Dance, 2024).\nHopefully, from this discussion, you can understand that a negative externality is when someone\nor something imposes an uncompensated cost on a 3rd party, uninvolved in the creation of the\nBitcoin mine’s noise, which costs the community through increased healthcare costs, decreased\nproperty value, and decreased quality of life. This negative externality represents an example of\nmarket failure as the external costs prevent the market from reaching efficiency.\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!\n– Econ 101 Study Buddy\nWord Count: 475\nWorks Cited\nDance, Gabriel. “Anxiety, Mood Swings and Sleepless Nights: Life Near a Bitcoin Mine.” News\nYork Times, 3 February 2024.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html?smid=url-share",

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nI am sorry to hear about your circumstances and inability to attend class recently. I will\ndo my best to explain market failure.\nMarket failure occurs when a market, without any form of intervention, fails to reach\nsocially optimal efficiency, even at equilibrium. So far, we have learned various manifestations\nof market failure. One form of market failure which I believe will be beneficial to discuss is\nexternalities. An externality is an external cost or benefit imposed on a third party in society as a\nresult of market activity. Consequently, the socially efficient outcome of the market is not met,\nresulting in a market failure. I want to particularly examine a negative externality, which is an\nexternal cost imposed on a third party in society as a result of market activity. To flesh out this\nidea, I have found a useful article to analyze together: Why Is Mercury Stubbornly High in\nTuna? Researchers Might Have an Answer.\n- The New Y ork Times\nThis article by Hiroko Tabuchi of the New Y ork Times discusses the high levels of\nmercury found in the ocean and sea-life, particularly discussing Tuna. The article attributes this\nchemical build-up to “human activities like mining and burning fossil fuels” (Tabuchi). This\npollution is the market failure present in this article, acting as a negative externality of the\nmineral/fossil fuel markets because of the external cost it imposes on third-parties in society. In\nspecific, the external cost resulting from mercury pollution is largely summarized as health\nissues in humans who consume the contaminated seafood.\nIn an efficient state, the aforementioned markets have two curves: producer’s marginal\ncost (supply) curve and consumer’s marginal benefit (demand) curve. However, when we\nconsider impacts on social efficiency, there is also the presence of an external marginal cost via\nour negative externality, summating a social marginal cost that is greater than the producer’s\nmarginal cost. This new SMC curve intersects with the social marginal benefit curve (simply the\nCMB curve, due to no presence of a positive externality), at a lower quantity than that of the\nPMC curve, indicating the efficient quantity equilibriums in these markets are lower than the\nmarket quantity equilibriums. This generates deadweight loss, verifying the inefficiency of this\nmarket failure.\nGiven this market failure, solutions should be sought. One viable solution is the\ngovernmental distribution of tradable emissions permits for mercury emissions, ones which\nwould sum to equal the quantity of mercury emissions produced by the markets in equilibrium\nstates. With these permits in the hands of producers, mercury emissions would be limited to a\nquantity that results in a SMC equivalent to the PMC, validly accounting for the external\nmarginal cost that resulted from the externality. With this correction, these markets would be\nbrought to their efficient outcomes. The only issue with this is the logistical difficulty of tracking\nsuch emissions, but for now, we will assume that it is feasible and logical.\nI hope this improved your understanding of market failure.\nBest,\nY our Classmate\nWord count: 498\nReferences:\n- Tabuchi, Hiroko. “Why Is Mercury Stubbornly High in Tuna?

This provided transportation is the government’s attempt to intervene, and‬\n‭ avoid market failure.‬\n‭ This article also shows the presence of an externality. In this case, by potentially decreasing voter‬\n‭ turnout, the externality is a less representative government, which affects everyone, even those‬\n‭ not directly involved in the policy change. This is a negative externality, because everyone is‬\n‭ negatively affected by a less representative government.‬\n‭ If the market is at equilibrium, it won't provide free transportation on election day because there's‬\n‭ no immediate profit in it. In other words, the marginal cost is greater than the marginal benefit‬\n‭ for any company to provide any free rides at all.

      "essay": "\tIn principle market failure is an inefficient usage of goods and services in a market, however there are several specific types of market failures that are important to consider when discussing market failure as a whole. Two primary subdivisions of market failures are referred to as public goods and externalities. However at first glance these may not seem to be market failures and rather functions of government, but this is not the case. Considering the public good of police service, while it is a necessary part of the economy one must remember that everyone, whether or not they pay taxes is entitled to the service of the police force. In regards to externalities they can either be positive(providing additional services that promote growth in an economy) or negative(providing additional services that promote economic/environmental decline). A specific example of a negative externality can be seen in the article “The Cost to Health and the Environment from Industrial Air Pollution in Europe - 2024(European)”. In this article they detail how pollution has increased over the past decade and how the governments of Europe over the past decade have spent approximately 2.7 to 4.3 trillion fighting air pollution so far, and that in 2021 2% of the European Union's GDP went to fighting air pollution(European). This is an example of a negative externality as the social cost of the companies producing goods and services is not accounted for, meaning that additional funds are required to pay to clean up the pollution that decades of production has caused. Due to not considering the additional societal cost of the pollution produced by the plants we would consider this pollution to be a negative externality and is a type of market inefficiency. \n\tThere are still two remaining types of market inefficiencies, those being common resources and artificially scarce goods. Common resources include any good that is provided for everyone for a free price, such as public roads or sidewalks. Finally artificially scarce resources include things such as movies you have to pay to watch, access to digital libraries, and any other service that could be provided in mass for the same level of challenge as providing it to only a few, however to gain money the good is made artificially scarce, which is an inefficiency as the economy is spending some effort on gaining access to the artificially scarce good, and in doing so not investing in something with true value. \n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nI hope that I can help your understanding of the idea of Market Failure. Market failure is\na situation in economics where the goods and services in the free market are distributed\ninefficiently. In other words, the market would be in disequilibrium. To help give context, in a\nperfect market, resources would be allocated productively and the supply would meet the\ndemand for the general market. For an example of market failure, I have left you an article by the\nNew Y ork Times that exemplifies a real world situation of what it is. The pollution is\ninefficiently distributed because non-participants are having a toxic gas being exposed to them\nthat is being emitted from the factories and power-plants in that area. The way that the gas\naffects these people is reported by them having asthma, low birth weights, and heart disease.\nThis is what is known as being a negative externality because it has “an uncompensated cost that\nan individual or firm imposes on others.” (Dr. Dudley, Slide 4). In this case, not everyone who is\nbeing affected by the pollution had a direct transaction with the factories and power plants,\nhowever they are still being affected by it. This is why it is a negative externality because it deals\na disadvantage (also known as external cost) to society. On the other hand, there are positive\nexternalities too. A positive externality is “A benefit that an individual or firm confers on others\nwithout receiving compensation.” (Dr. Dudley, Slide 4). To put into a simpler perspective, it is\nlike someone having a nice front yard in a neighborhood. The other people in that neighborhood\nbenefit from that front yard because it makes their neighborhood look nice and clean even\nthough they did not directly contribute to making the yard look nice. This is also known as an\nexternal benefit. Another example would be vaccinations. Not only is someone protecting\nthemself, but they are also protecting others by not spreading germs anymore so the people\naround the person who was vaccinated are benefited even though they did not contribute to the\nvaccination. In a more economic view, market failure is when the market is not maximized to\nsocietal welfare. It means that the market equilibrium price and quantity is not true to what costs\nand the benefits to society actually look like. When this happens there is an inefficient amount of\ngoods that are produced which leads to things like deadweight loss.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nAs you told me that you're not understanding the concept of market failure in our Economics 101 class, I thought I'd explain it to you using a real-world example from a recent news article. Market failure is the situation where the free market fails to use resources efficiently, leading to an outcome for society that is not the best possible outcome.\nOne of the first causes of market failure is externalities. Externalities are the uncompensated costs or benefits that come from an economic trade and are carried out by third parties not directly involved in the transaction. In other words, the production or consumption of a good or service makes external costs or benefits that are not in the market price.\nA recent article in The New York Times, titled \"The Hidden Air Pollution Costs of Industries in Europe\" (Venkataramanan, 2023), highlights the issue of externalities caused by industrial air pollution in Europe. The article discusses a report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) that estimates the external costs of air pollution from industries in the European Union (EU).\nAccording to the report, industrial air emissions in the EU had an estimated external cost of between €2.7 to €4.3 trillion over the last decade (2012-2021), with an average of €268 to €428 billion per year (Venkataramanan, 2023). These external costs are primarily made by society in the form of bad health effects, such as increased diseases, and environmental damage, including crop losses and worsening of ecosystems.\nThe article explains that while Europe's industry has made progress in reducing its environmental and climate impacts, the external costs caused by air pollution from industry remain significant. Most importantly, the energy sector (thermal plants generating electricity and heat) was responsible for nearly 80% of the decrease in total external costs over the last decade, driven by the implementation of best available techniques and a shift toward less polluting and carbon fuels (Venkataramanan, 2023).\nThe market failure in this case is a thing because the production costs of industrial goods and services do not include the external costs imposed on society and the environment. As a result, the market prices of these goods and services are lower than their true social costs, leading to overproduction and overconsumption. This situation is a classic example of a negative externality, where the social costs of production are not fully made by the producers or consumers.\nTo address this market failure, the article suggests that the European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Action Plan can further support the objective of decreasing pollution impacts from the industrial sector (Venkataramanan, 2023). By internalizing these external costs through appropriate policies, such as pollution taxes, emissions trading schemes, or regulatory measures, the market can start to want to produce and consume at socially optimal levels.\nIn summary, the article effectively illustrates the concept of market failure due to negative externalities, specifically in the context of industrial air pollution in Europe. It highlights the need for policy interventions to correct this market failure and ensure that the true social costs of production are reflected in market prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nKartal, O.

      "essay": "Econ 101\nDr. Dudley\nMarch 26th, 2024\nEcon 101 classmate,\nI hope everything is well with you! I understand how the concept of “market failure” is\nconfusing, so I want to explain it further to help you keep up with the coursework. I figured\nusing a recent news article would help explain market failure in a comprehensible way.\nFirst, the general concept of market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services is\nnot efficient. It occurs when the equilibrium price and quantity in a market are not optimal for\nsociety, leading to an overall social welfare loss. When market failures occur, the market does\nnot allocate resources efficiently and leads society to outcomes and prices that are not ideal.\nMarket failures can happen due to various reasons, including negative externalities, artificially\nscarce resources, public goods, and other factors as well.\nIn Y oko Kubota’s, “The Blacklisted Component That’s Disrupting the Luxury Car Market”, she\nreports how a commonly used magnetic component made by a blacklisted Chinese company is\nbehind the holdup of thousands of luxury car shipments to the US. The part itself, a LAN\ntransformer, is used to connect cars and computers to networks and was inside a control system\nfor vehicles being shipped by V olkswagen. The tiny part was made by a Chinese company called\nSichuan Jingweida Technology which supplied the part to another supplier, not directly to\nV olkswagen. The company’s blacklisting, and therefore limited supply, caused the carmaker to\nhold back imports of the LAN transformer to Porche, Audi, and Bentley cars into the U.S. This\nwill hold until V olkswagen finds a way to ensure their supply chain complies with standards and\nreplaces the scarce part.\nThe limited supply of LAN transformers has led to a market failure, specifically because it\nresults in artificially scarce goods. The company is holding back production of the LAN\ntransformer to keep the supply limited and taking advantage of the situation by raising prices for\nconsumers. By restricting the supply of cars through the part, manufacturers can increase prices.\nConsumers pay more than they would in a competitive market, so the price distortion leads to a\nmisallocation of resources and a consumer welfare loss. This supply chain disruption is a market\nfailure, harming consumers and leading to an inequitable distribution of resources. Artificially\nscarce goods result in waste and inefficiency, as manufacturers can intentionally limit the number\nof products to encourage demand and distort prices. This leads to waste, the inefficient allocation\nof resources, and a loss of consumer welfare. Artificially scarce goods lead to market failures\ndue to the misallocation of resources and the heavy distortion of prices.\nWhen market failures happen, there is room for government intervention to improve social\nwelfare. This government interference can occur in various ways, including taxes, subsidies, and\ndifferent forms of regulation. I hope this information helped clear up the concept of market\nfailures and gave you a better understanding of market failure in the real world.\nSincerely,\nY our Econ 101 friend\nWord Count: 485\nWorks Cited\nThe Blacklisted Component That’ s Disrupting the Luxury-Car Market - WSJ,\nwww.wsj.com/business/autos/the-blacklisted-component-thats-disrupting-the-luxury-car-market-\ndf87a3b3.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\tI hope all is well. I understand that market failure has been difficult for you to grasp and that you would like a specific example of this in effect. Market failure, defined according to Professor Dudley, is when the market, minus intervention, fails to achieve the efficient outcome at equilibrium. The efficient outcome is when Total Surplus is maximized. The types of market failure discussed in class so far have been Externalities, Public Goods, Common Resources, and Artificially Scarce Goods. \nThe best way I can explain market failure to you is through an externality example from the New York Times. The article describes how microplastics have extreme negative impacts on society, despite their economic convenience. The market on its own demands high quantities of microplastics at equilibrium because “plastics have indeed been a game changer for humanity, and the enormous range of cheap, durable plastic goods, from food containers and PVC pipes to polyester clothing and single-use medical products, have inarguably improved life” (Jacobs). However, the market equilibrium quantity has produced an external cost for third parties. The article references how microplastics contaminate our oceans and environment, as well as human cardiovascular and neurological systems, which ultimately causes diseases and brain tumors (Jacobs). This burden on these outside parties must be considered as a part of Total Surplus, and therefore, it must be subtracted from consumer and producer surplus. Hence, the market equilibrium quantity does not maximize Total Surplus, which results in market failure. To achieve market efficiency, the market must consider this external cost and operate at a lower quantity. This was expressed in the article as the solution, “We just have to use less plastic” (Jacobs). \n\tThe example provided above is a negative externality, where the efficient quantity is less than the market quantity and there is an external cost for third parties. There is a second type of externality called a positive externality, which operates the same way except in reverse. The efficient quantity is more than the market quantity because the market produces an external benefit for a third party. In order to find where these efficient quantities exist for both externalities, you must find where Social Marginal Benefit intersects Social Marginal Cost. This requires you to add the external cost or external benefit to the marginal cost or marginal benefit, depending on the type of externality. \n\tExternalities are market failures, so in most cases they would require government intervention to achieve the efficient quantity. A positive externality can only be solved with a government subsidy, but a negative externality could be solved a few different ways. In the case of the microplastic market referenced earlier, the government could intervene in three different ways. They could impose environmental standards, taxes, or quotas to reduce the market quantity, and in all three of these scenarios they have the option to utilize them on either the externality itself or the market. I hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions!\n\nBest,\nStudent\n\nWord Count: 500\n\n\n\nAndrew, Jacobs. \"Nytimes.com.\" The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html.

      "essay": "Dear Friend, \n\nA market failure is when resources are not properly distributed. This results in inefficiency and can occur from people acting selfishly and not considering what may be best for society in terms of reaching an efficient outcome. \nIn a recent New York Times article, author Andrew Jacobs discusses microplastics and their negative impacts on human and wildlife health. Jacobs describes how millions of tons of plastic do not get properly recycled and then go into the ocean. This then has led to animals having microplastics inside of them. Additionally, some of these animals get consumed by humans resulting in microplastics inside of them. The consumption of sea animals is just one of the many ways that microplastics get inside of humans. Beyond consumption of animals, due to the mass amounts of plastics in the general environment, this results in microplastics inside of humans. When these microplastics are inside the human body, there can be extremely negative health impacts in the future. Jacobs references researchers and states how those with microplastics in their bodies have an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. All of this supports the central argument of this piece of how people in society need to use less plastic. \nIn this situation, the type of market failure presented is a negative externality. This is because of the idea of pollution. As people pollute plastics, they are harming other members of society and their health. The microplastics can get inside of people and lead to adverse health effects. Pollution is one of the most common types of negative externalities. However, there are other examples but this article is centered around pollution. This also correlates with the main definition of a market failure. With pollution, people contribute to this problem by not considering the societal cost of their actions. \nWhen there is a negative externality, the market graph is impacted. Starting at equilibrium, a negative externality results in a new social marginal cost that has a higher price and lower quantity than the equilibrium price and quantity. This makes sense because as a negative externality occurs, society will be better off if there is less quantity of that given good. In the example from the article, society will be better off if people pollute less plastic leading to a reduced amount of microplastics. Furthermore, the price of plastics will increase as a result of this negative externality because fewer people will buy the good.  \n\n\nWord Count: 405\n\n\nSources (MLA 9th Edition): \n\nTeam, The Investopedia. “Market Failure: What It Is in Economics, Common Types, and Causes.” Investopedia, Investopedia, www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketfailure.asp#:~:text=Market%20failure%20refers%20to%20inefficient,%2Dthan%2Doptimal%20economic%20outcomes.

Y ou’ve reached out about market\nfailure, and I believe the article from The New Y ork Times, titled “Microplastics Are a Big\nProblem, a New Film Warns,” by Andrew Jacobs, provides a perfect real-world example to\nillustrate this concept, particularly focusing on the negative externalities of plastic production\nand disposal.\nFirst, let’s break down what market failure means. In economics, market failure occurs when the\nallocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. That is, there are certain costs\nor benefits that do not reflect in the transaction between a buyer and a seller, leading to outcomes\nthat can be harmful to society.\nThe article discusses the issue of microplastics, tiny plastic particles that have infiltrated almost\nevery part of our environment, including the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we\neat. These microplastics originate from a variety of sources, including larger plastic debris that\ndegrades into smaller pieces, synthetic fibers from clothing, and even directly from products like\ncosmetics. The production and disposal of plastic, as highlighted in the article, have been largely\nunchecked due to insufficient regulatory laws, allowing businesses to operate without\nconsidering the full environmental and health costs of their products.\nFor example, companies like bottled water producers or manufacturers of single use plastic items\ncontribute significantly to plastic waste. While these businesses profit from the convenience and\nlow production costs of plastic, the negative externalities, such as pollution and health risks from\nmicroplastics, are not accounted for in their business models. This discrepancy is a classic\nexample of market failure: the true cost of plastic production and consumption is not borne by\nthe producers or consumers but is instead imposed on society at large and the environment.\nThis situation highlights a negative externality, where the actions of businesses and consumers\nhave unintended harmful effects on third parties and the environment. The failure here is that the\nmarket does not naturally correct this inefficiency, leading to excessive plastic production and\ndisposal without incorporating the environmental and health costs into the price of plastic goods.\nThe consequence is widespread environmental degradation and health hazards, as microplastics\naccumulate in our ecosystems and bodies, posing unknown long term health risks.\nUnderstanding market failure through the lens of microplastics shows the importance of\nregulatory interventions to correct such inefficiencies. Governments may impose regulations and\ntaxes on plastic production, encourage recycling and waste management initiatives, or invest in\nresearch for biodegradable alternatives to mitigate these externalities.\nI hope this example helps clarify the concept of market failure and how it can lead to significant\nsocietal and environmental issues.\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out if you have more questions.

      "essay": "To: My Friend\nSubject: Market Failures\nHello, in this email I will attempt to help you better understand the concept of a market failure. A\nmarket failure is when the market fails to be efficient without any government intervention. A\nmarket is considered to be efficient when the total surplus is maximized. There are several ways\nin which a market can fail to be efficient: externalities, common resources, public goods, and\nartificially scarce goods. In the article I will be referencing to explain market failure I will be\nfocusing on externalities. Externalities can be positive or negative. I will describe how a negative\nexternality leads to a market failure. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost that an\nindividual or firm imposes on others. A market failure is measured by finding the total surplus at\nmarket equilibrium, identifying the efficient outcome, and then finding deadweight loss by\nmeasuring the difference between the two. The efficient outcome is when total surplus is\nmaximized, which is society's net gain from the market. Y ou can find where society's total net\ngain is maximized by finding where social marginal benefit intersects social marginal cost.\nSocial marginal cost is the producer's marginal cost plus the external marginal cost. In the case of\na negative externality, the external marginal cost would be the extra cost implemented on society\nas a consequence of the externality.\nThe article “Nearly Half the States Sue E.P .A. Over New Limits on Deadly Pollution” by The\nNew York Times describes the state’s reactions to the Environmental Protection Agency lowering\nthe limit on the amount of fine industrial particles, a type of pollutant, that is legally allowed to\nbe emitted based on a decision by the Biden administration. The market failure in this case is\ncaused by the negative externality from the pollution produced by manufacturers. This is a\nnegative externality because the fine industrial particles have unintended health consequences for\nthose not involved in the manufacturing process, such as an increased risk of heart disease,\nasthma, and low birth weight. These externalities impose external costs on the market, raising the\nsocial marginal cost. The external costs from the pollutants were not equivalent to any marginal\nbenefit from the products the factories creating this pollutant were producing. Before the E.P .A.\nlowered the limits on the amount of air pollution legally allowed to be emitted, there was a\nmarket failure because of the inefficiently high amount of pollution being emitted by\nmanufacturers. As claimed by the article, lowering the limits on the amount of this pollutant\nallowed would deliver up to $46 billion in net health benefits within a year. This is an example of\nhow the government can intervene to fix a market failure.\nHopefully, this article about a real-life market failure was a clear example of how negative\nexternalities, such as pollution, can cause inefficiencies that lead to market failures. I hope this\nexplanation helped you better understand the concepts you missed in class.\nSincerely,\nY our friend\nWord Count: 490\nReferences\nFriedman, L. (2024, March 6).

      "essay": "Hello friend,\nI found an article that will help you understand market failures; it deals with the\ndeployment of State Police officers and National Guard soldiers to patrol NYC subway\nplatforms, in response to concerns about safety and crime in the subway system. First, let’s go\nover some terms that will help you grasp market failures.\nA market failure occurs when a market fails to produce the efficient quantity necessary\nfor equilibrium—causing the demand and supply curves to not meet at the market’s true\nequilibrium point, often leading to high prices (Dudley, 2024). To explain examples of market\nfailures, you need to understand how goods can be classified. A good that’s excludable is one in\nwhich the supplier of a good can prevent people, who don’t pay for the use of that good, from\nconsuming it (Dudley, 2024). A good that’s rival in consumption is one in which the same unit of\na good cannot be consumed by more than one person at a time (Dudley, 2024). An example of a\nmarket failure is a public good.\nA public good is non-excludable, but it’s also non-rival in consumption—you don’t have\nto pay for it, and multiple people can use it at the same time. This is a prominent example of a\nmarket failure because consumers do not have to pay producers for the service, leading to people\navoiding payment–which causes the free-rider problem. The free-rider problem is when\nconsumers are enjoying a good or service without paying for it (Dudley, 2024). This is also a\ngood example of a market failure because the marginal cost, the cost incurred of producing one\nmore good, of allowing an additional consumer to use it is zero; it doesn’t cost anything for\ncompanies to provide additional units of the goods. This is seen with services, watching sporting\nevents, or national defense.\nIn NYC, subway safety is a regular concern from the rise in crime (Cramer, 2024). Since\nthe subway system is a vital public transportation system, ensuring safety in the subways is hard\ndue to limited resources. To comply with the dangers, Mayor Eric Adams, ordered national guard\nsoldiers and state police officers to patrol NYC subway platforms and check passengers bags,\naiming to strengthen safety (Dudley, 2024). This is a prime example of a public goods market\nfailure because the security from the national guard is non-rival in consumption: one person\nexperiencing the safety doesn’t prevent others from being able to also receive safety. The\nmarginal cost of providing treatment to another person is essentially zero, so the efficient price to\nconsumers should be zero, yet sellers don't charge a positive price because the drugs are\nnon-excludable. Everyone is receiving the benefit from the implementation and they are not able\nto exclude it to only paying tax payers.\nAs time goes on, the issue will start to resolve itself as the government would typically\nintervene and implement new standards or regulations to fix any failures. I hope this concept is\nclearer now.\nWORD COUNT: 499\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/subway-national-guard-police.html?searchResult\nPosition=1\nWorks Cited\nCramer, Maria, and Ana Ley. “National Guard and State Police Will Patrol the Subways and\nCheck Bags.” The New York Times, The New Y ork Times, June 3AD,\nwww.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/nyregion/subway-national-guard-police.html?searchResul\ntPosition=1.

Ideally, the free market\nshould maximize total surplus in order to ensure the most efficient distribution of goods and\nservices. An externality is a type of market failure that occurs when the free market doesn’t\nrecognize that there is an external benefit or cost to other people. Externalities lead to\ninefficiencies in the free market. Negative externalities always produce too much, meaning that\nthe free market quantity is greater than the socially optimal quantity. On the other hand, positive\nexternalities always produce too little, meaning that the socially optimal quantity is less than the\nfree market quantity.\nThe Washington Post article “Livestock industry co-opts academics to downplay its\nclimate impact, study says” highlights a negative externality as a market failure. The article\nfocuses on UC Davis and Colorado State University’s recent acceptance of large donations from\nthe livestock industry, raising concerns that they will function as extensions of the industry rather\nthan independent research centers for agriculture. Accepting funding from the livestock industry\nleads critics to believe that the universities’ research findings will be biased, despite the livestock\nindustry’s responsibility for fifteen percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is a\nnegative externality because surrounding communities, people who are uninvolved in the\nlivestock industry, are being harmfully impacted by the greenhouse gasses emitted by the\nlivestock industry. These emissions contribute to climate change and could also lead to\nrespiratory issues for surrounding citizens.\n2\nTo further understand market failures, it is important to note the four types of goods,\nincluding: private goods, public goods, artificially scarce goods, and common resources. Goods\nmay be excludable and/or rivalrous. Excludable goods mean that people may not be able to use\nthem if they have not paid. A rival good means that the consumption by one person diminishes\nothers’ ability to also consume that good. Common resources are rivalrous and non-excudable,\nwhile artificially scarce goods are excludable and non-rivalrous. Public goods are neither\nexcludable or rivalrous. For example, clean air is a public good. In relation to the negative\nexternality mentioned previously in the article, clean air is a public good, so it should be\naccessible to everyone. Greenhouse gases emitted by the livestock industry prevent the public\nfrom having clean air, despite its lack of excludability and rivalry. I hope this letter helps better\nexplain market failures, specifically negative externalities.\nSincerely,\nFriend\nWord Count: 417 words\n3\nWork Cited\nPhillips, Anna. “Livestock industry co-opts academics to downplay its climate impact, study\nsays.” The Washington Post, 8 March 2024,\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/03/08/livestock-industry-co\nws-climate-impact/",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nMarket failure occurs when there is an inefficient allocation of resources in the free\nmarket. Therefore, the efficient point, or where total surplus is maximized, does not equal the\nmarket’s equilibrium point. Some examples of market failure are externalities, common\nresources, public goods, and artificially scarce goods.\nExternalities, which can be positive or negative, are a type of market failure in which the\nmarket does not account for a cost (in the case of a negative externality) or benefit (in the case\nof a positive externality) that affects a third party separate from the producers or consumers. For\nexample, a positive externality would be if all of your coworkers get vaccinated against the flu\nbut you do not, you will still benefit because they cannot spread the flu to you. Climate change is\nan example of a negative externality, because its effects are felt by everyone even though only\nsome of the population are contributing to its acceleration.\nTypes of goods are also market failures. Goods are defined as excludable when the\nsupplier of that good can prevent people who do not pay from consuming it, and are defined as\nrival in consumption when the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one\nperson at the same time. Artificially scarce goods, such as cable television, are non-rival in\nconsumption and excludable. Common resources, such as clean water, are non-excludable and\nrival in consumption. Public goods, such as national defense, are non-excludable and nonrival\nin consumption.\nA recent New York Times article titled “North Carolina ‘Forever Chemical’ Plant Violates\nHuman Rights, U.N. Panel Says” (T abuchi 2024) highlights how the dumped wastewater from a\nchemical plant in North Carolina is highly contaminated and as a result is becoming extremely\nunsafe for the surrounding communities. This is an example of externalities as a market failure.\nThis situation illustrates a type of negative externality. Although the surrounding communities\nare making no contribution to this market, they are the ones being negatively impacted through\nair pollution and an unsafe water source.\nIt is an unaccounted external cost because it negatively affects the community through\npoor air quality, unreliable drinking water, and negative health effects, which creates a social\nmarginal cost curve. The existence of the social marginal cost curve adds external marginal cost\nto the producer’s marginal cost, which creates a new curve above the existing supply curve.\nThis new curve takes away from the total surplus and creates a negative surplus, which means\nthat the market is not trading at the efficient point. Therefore, a market failure is created.\nBest,\nYour Fellow Econ 101 Student\nWord Count: 466\nWorks Cited\nT abuchi, H. (2024, February 27).

      "essay": "Hi friend,\nTo refresh your memory, remember that the term “market failure” refers to the occurrence\nwhen a given market fails to reach its efficient outcome. We can identify the efficient outcome as\nwhen the market produces the maximum total surplus possible. It is important to remember that\nthe “efficient outcome” is not the “equilibrium outcome,” as a market can be at equilibrium but\nbe inefficient if it is not maximizing total surplus. Market failures can be created by externalities,\nor when a third party is affected by the market, by market power, or by the distribution of\nnon-private goods.\nWe’ve been focusing on externalities in class, so I’ll elaborate on those. There are two\nkinds of externalities. A negative externality is an external cost that negatively impacts a third\nparty outside of the producer and consumer, and a positive externality is an external benefit that\npositively impacts this third party. Participants in a market with a negative externality will\noverproduce the good or service as they do not consider the external costs that are borne on a\nthird party. Similarly, participants in a market with a positive externality will underproduce the\ngood or service as they are not aware of the external benefit that is gained by a third party. Both\nwill lead the market to stray from the efficient quantity for the market and create a market\nfailure.\nTo put this concept into perspective, I found a recent article from the Wall Street Journal\nthat illustrates a relevant market failure and negative externality. The article, titled “How the\nHousing Market Slowdown Is Rippling Through the Economy in Five Charts,” discusses how\nthe increase in housing interest rates and consequential decrease in purchases of new housing\nnegatively impacts four other related markets: home furnishings, labor for home-improvement\nbusinesses, home construction, and residential building permits. The negative externality in this\nscenario is the increasing interest rates on housing as the four markets above bear a negative\nexternal cost due to fewer consumers for homes and a corresponding lack of need for these\nmarkets. Thus, these four markets fail to be efficient as they cannot maximize total surplus while\nbearing the external cost of the increasing interest rates. This “failure to be efficient” is\nmanifested in unemployment as these markets cannot compensate for the external cost.\nTo solve this problem, the government could either engage directly with the externality or\nwith the market to push towards efficiency. In most cases, it is more effective to engage directly\nwith the externality. A possible solution via direct engagement with the externality would be to\nlower the interest rates on homes, which would increase home consumption and demand and\nthus increase demand in the four markets above, eliminating the external cost. Engaging with the\nmarket directly in this scenario would mean more unemployment and layoffs, as this would\nallow the markets to accommodate the external cost without eliminating it; this would not be\nsmart or effective.\nHope this helps!\n- Y our riend\nWord Count: 493 (body)\nWork Cited\nTorry, Harriet. “How the Housing Market Slowdown Is Rippling Through the Economy in Five\nCharts.” The Wall Street Journal, 19 December 2023,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/how-the-housing-market-slowdown-is-rippling-t\nhrough-the-economy-in-five-charts-b90b789a.

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIn economics, it is often assumed that individual decisions motivated by self-interest\nultimately benefit society as a whole. However, market failure arises when individual incentives\nfail to align with the maximization of society’s overall welfare, challenging this notion.\nEssentially, market failure is when the market does not produce at the efficient quantity naturally,\nnecessitating government intervention. This imbalance causes a reduction in total surplus,\ncreating deadweight loss, which serves as a clear indicator of market failure. Market failure\nmanifests in various forms namely, public goods, artificially scarce goods, common resources,\nand externalities.\nSpecifically, an externality refers to the unintended cost or benefit that impacts a third\nparty due to the production or consumption of a good. Graphically, the marginal social benefit\nand cost curves illustrate the nature of market failure and the impact of an externality on society.\nFor instance, if the social benefit exceeds demand, a third party is receiving an unintentional\nbenefit. On the other hand, a negative externality arises when the social cost surpasses supply,\nsignifying an external cost that the market overlooks and therefore overproduces, such as\npollution.\nIn recent years, the fashion industry has been criticized for its overproduction,\noverconsumption, and role in environmental degradation. Due to a failure to read the market\ncoupled with economic interests, brands often produce more than they sell, resulting in as much\nas 40% of clothing made each year or 60 billion unsold garments that create large accumulations\nof waste and misused resources (Tonti, 1). Carbon emissions expelled in the atmosphere during\nthe production and consumption of clothing contribute to climate change leading to individuals,\ncommunities, and future generations to bear the brunt of these impacts such as health impacts,\nenvironmental degradation, and infrastructure costs. Clearly, there is a significant social cost\nrelated to the consumption and production of clothing that the market is unable to alleviate\nwithout government intervention showing that the market for clothing produces too much.\nIn theory, to address the externality and enhance efficiency, the market should operate at\nthe point where the marginal social cost intersects with the marginal social benefit. While this\napproach decreases transaction costs by limiting production and increasing prices, it also impacts\ntotal surplus. According to Tonti’s article, government initiatives that place a quota on\ngreenhouse gas emissions could be helpful, however the question of whether to place this quota\non the producers or consumers is controversial (Tonti, 2). Furthermore, one organization in the\narticle argues that a tax of 6 cents per item paid by the producer may assist, however others argue\nthe tax must be higher for a meaningful reduction. In general, directly taxing the externality is\nthe most efficient strategy for addressing negative externalities. By imposing a tax the market is\nmoved away from the equilibrium point towards the optimal quantity and price level, effectively\ndiscouraging both production and consumption. In this case, a tax of sufficient quantity on\nclothing items and funds going to vulnerable communities will help subside the effects of\nclothing production.

      "essay": "Good Afternoon,\nI hope this message finds you well despite the challenging circumstances you’re facing. I\nunderstand that the concept of market failure is unfamiliar, but I am here to explain the concept\nclearly, and I even found an article that I think you may find interesting!\nTo start, the economic concept of market failure refers to situations where the free market\ndoes not distribute resources efficiently, leading to a loss of economic value. However, you\nmight be wondering how we assess market failure and its implications for economic welfare.\nOne significant form of market failure is known as a negative externality, which occurs when an\nindividual or firm imposes costs on others without compensation.\nPollution is a prominent example of a negative externality that affects the global\ncommunity, resulting from actions taken by individuals or firms without considering their\nbroader impact. For instance, the New Y ork Times article 'Microplastics are a Big Problem, a\nNew Film Warns' highlights how human consumption of plastics leads to air pollution from\nmicroplastic particles, illustrating the impact of this externality. With microplastics, their\nwidespread use and disposal lead to pollution that the market prices of these plastic products do\nnot account for. This pollution has profound implications for ecosystems and human health- costs\nthat manufacturers and consumers do not pay for directly, which results in overconsumption and\noverproduction of plastic. For example, the author of the NYT article explains that microplastics\nare now embedded in a wide range of living creatures, including the seafood we eat, therefore\nindirectly affecting the health of both animals and humans.\nFrom a graphical perspective, when the marginal benefit curve (MBC), representing\nconsumers' willingness to pay for plastic products without considering externalities, intersects\nthe marginal cost curve (MCC), which represents the costs to producers and manufacturers\nwithout considering externalities, we reach market equilibrium. However, when an externality\n(microplastic pollution) occurs, the social marginal cost curve (the external costs of pollution\nfrom microplastics on ecosystems and human health) shifts to the left creating a new optimal\nefficient price and quantity that is not reflected in the market. That efficient price and quantity\noccurs where social marginal cost intersects the social marginal benefit, which can only be\nachieved through government implementation of taxes on plastic production, or stricter\nenvironmental regulations, to bring the market price to that efficient price point. However, it is\ncritical to mention that without proper policy implementation, deadweight loss will be created\nresulting in overall loss for both consumer surplus and producer surplus. With proper\nintervention, the social cost of consumption of plastics would be better reflected in the\nmarketplace, incentivizing a reduction in plastic use and the resulting negative externalities of\nmicroplastic pollution.\nIn total, the article illustrates the prevalence of microplastics in the environment and\nhuman bodies, highlighting how individual actions and market transactions can impose hidden\ncosts on society. I hope this explanation of market failures makes sense to you, and please feel\nfree to reach out if you have questions!\nSincerely,\nY our friend\nWord count: 496\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, A.

This occurs as the total surplus is not maximized, resulting in deadweight loss and inefficiency. Market failures can be produced for multiple reasons, including Positive Externalities, Negative Externalities, Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scarce Goods. A positive Externality is a “benefit that that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation. Also known as an external benefit.” On the other hand, a negative externality is “an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others. Also known as an External Benefit.” \n\nIn order to make it easier for you to understand the concept of market failure, I found an article which clearly demonstrates the presence of a negative externality. The article discusses The Smokehouse Creek Fire in Texas, which was ignited by power lines belonging to the Xcel Energy company. As a result of the fires, hundreds of structures were left in ruins and more than 1 million acres were burned in the Texas Panhandle. This is a perfect example of a negative externality, as the Xcel Energy company, a private “firm”, imposed an uncompensated cost, the destruction of hundreds of structures, on many individuals, with the sole purpose of increasing profits. Negative externalities are classified as market failures, as the market equilibrium, the point where supply (producer marginal cost) and demand (consumer marginal benefit) meet, is inefficient and does not maximize total surplus. In this case, society is made up of consumers, producers, and the 3rd party which is harmed by the externality / fire. In order to reach efficiency, the supply, in this case the Marginal Cost of the Xcel Energy company, must shift left or decrease, to reach the reach the point where social marginal cost ( Producer Marginal Cost + External Marginal Cost) is equal to Demand (Consumer's Marginal Benefit.)  As a result, total surplus would be maximized as the positive total surplus will remain while the negative total surplus will be eliminated. In order to reach this efficient point, the government should intervene and implement one of the three policies: standardization, taxation, or a quota / limit on the amount of a good or service that can be bought or produced. \n\nI hope my example of a negative externality was able to help you grasp the broader understanding of market failures.\n\nWord Count: 413\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited \nMadani, Doha. “Xcel Energy Says Its Facilities May Have Started Largest Texas Wildfire in State History.” NBCNews.Com, NBCUniversal News Group, 7 Mar. 2024, www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/xcel-energy-says-facilities-may-started-largest-texas-wildfire-state-h-rcna142260. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "essay": "Dr. Dudley\nWriting Assignment 3: Market Failure\nDear Friend,\nMarket Failure happens when the Market Equilibrium Price and Quantity are not\nefficient, meaning that Total Surplus is not maximized. Total Surplus is society’s Total Net Gain\nproduced by the market which in this case is the sum of Consumer and Producer Surplus. This\ncan happen for multiple reasons including Externalities and Artificially Scarce Goods (Dudley,\nConsumer and Producer Surplus).\nExternalities occur when the production or consumption of a good/service affects\nindividuals who are not directly involved. There are two types of Externalities: Positive and\nNegative. Positive Externalities occur when an individual benefits from a good without\ncompensating for their benefit. Negative Externalities occur when an individual has an\nuncompensated cost imposed on them. In either case since these effects are not reflected in the\nprice of the goods or service, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently and maximize\nsociety’s Total Benefit (Dudley, Externalities).\nArtificially Scarce Goods are goods that could be produced in abundance but are\nintentionally restricted in supply to maintain high prices and exclusivity. They are non-rival in\nconsumption and excludable, meaning a unit of the good can be consumed by multiple people at\na time but the supplier can prevent people who do not pay from accessing the good. By\nartificially limiting the supply of a good, producers can charge higher prices, leading to an\ninefficient allocation of resources (Dudley, Public Goods and Common Resources).\nA good example of a Market Failure is highlighted by a Wall Street Journal article\ndetailing how restaurants are increasingly reluctant to accommodate large parties due to staffing\nshortages and increasing food costs, which leads to frustration among diners struggling to secure\nreservations for large parties (Dizik).\nThe primary Market Failure in this scenario is the noise pollution inherent with large\nparties, which imposes costs on other diners by disrupting their dining experience and reducing\ntheir enjoyment. This leads to inefficiency because the Negative Externality of noise pollution is\nnot fully accounted for in the market, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources and a\nfailure to maximize total surplus for all parties involved.\nThis type of Market Failure is classified as a Negative Externality, as noise pollution is\nthe uncompensated cost that the restaurant would impose on its other customers if they were to\nhave reservations for large parties.\nAnother Market Failure apparent in this article is Artificially Scarce Goods as large party\nreservations are non-rival in consumption and excludable. Since one party's use of a large table\ndoesn't diminish the ability of another party to use it at the same time, and large table\nreservations can be controlled by the restaurant.\nThe scarcity of large table reservations is not inherent but rather created by the\nrestaurant's policies and operational constraints.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope this message finds you in good health and that all is well with your family. It has\ncome to my attention that you were forced to miss the lecture on market failure, due to a personal\nmatter, however I wanted to reassure you that under my guidance, you will fully understand the\nconcept and its intricacies. To help you comprehend the concept, I will first define market\nfailure, before going on to address a specific instance which demonstrates it. Market failure is the\nname attributed to the failure of a market to operate at the point of efficiency, even in\nequilibrium, absent any intervention from an external entity, such as the government. Efficiency\nis said to be the point at which total surplus, or societies net gain from the market, is maximized.\nTo measure the harm caused by an externality, simply calculate the difference between the\nefficient outcome and the total surplus at market equilibrium. Market failure can present itself in\na plethora of ways, through externalities, common resources, public goods and artificially scarce\ngoods, however, for simplicity's sake, I will specifically detail how externalities may contribute\nto market failure. There are two types of externalities, negative and positive. When a negative\nexternality exists, this means that the market equilibrium contributes to an overproduction of\ngoods relative to the efficient level. Graphically, this may present itself if the form of the social\nmarginal cost curve (representing the true cost to society) being set above supply. Conversely, in\nthe presence of a positive externality, not enough units are produced relative to the equilibrium\npoint. In this case, the social marginal benefit (consumer MB + external MB) is higher than the\ndemand, which strictly represents the benefit to the consumer.\nAn instance in which a negative externality was portrayed is when an oil spill took place\noff the coast of the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, after a barge had been overturned\nwhile en route from Panama to Guyana. According to The Washington Post, due to the spill,\nbeaches on the coast of Tobago, which play a fundamental role in the country's tourism sector,\nhave been severely blackened and contaminated, providing a severe threat to the health of\nbeachgoers and wildlife alike. This situation thoroughly depicts a negative externality, because it\nshows how a third party (those not involved in the sale or distribution of oil), were forced to\nendure the negative effects of those participating in the market for oil.

Since you had to leave abruptly, I wanted to help you\nwith explaining the concept of market failures as we are learning it in class. I came across a\nrecent article in the New Y ork Times that I think provides a clear example. The article “Cancer\nDrug Shortage Leaves Patients in Limbo” sheds light on a critical significant issue in the\nhealthcare sector. A market failure occurs when any intervention (even the government) in the\nmarket fails to reach an efficient outcome, even in equilibrium. In class, we learned about the\nfour different types of market failures: externalities, common resources, artificially scarce\nresources, and public goods. In this case, the shortage of cancer drugs exemplifies a form of\nmarket failure known as a negative externality. A negative externality is an uncompensated cost\nthat an individual or firm imposes on others.\nExternalities occur when the product or consumption affects a third party who is not\ndirectly involved in the transaction. The shortage of cancer drugs affects not only the patients\nwho directly need the medication, but also their families, caregivers, and the broader health\nsystem. This scarcity results in negative externalities because it impacts the well-being of\nindividuals beyond those directly involved. Patients who can’t access the necessary medication\nmay experience worsened health outcomes, increased stress, and financial burdens. Their\nfamilies and caregivers may also bear the emotional and financial costs of the shortage as the\ntreatments are increasing in price. This situation exemplifies how the market fails to account for\nthe full social costs and benefits of producing and consuming cancer drugs. The market’s focus\non profit maximization may lead to underproduction or inefficient distribution of medications,\nresulting in significant negative consequences for society. The shortage of cancer drugs\nhighlights the market’s inefficiencies in allocating measures to meet the demand for essential\nmedications. Patients in need of those drugs face significant challenges due to limited\navailability, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes or even the loss of life.\nUnderstanding market failure through real-world examples like the shortage of cancer\ndrugs highlights the importance of considering externalities. By recognizing the broader impacts,\npolicymakers can implement measures to internalize these externalities and promote a more\nefficient allocation of resources for the greater good.\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the concepts of market failure, particularly negative\nexternalities.

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nI hope all is well with you, and I wanted to reach out in order to share some riveting\ninformation about an economic concept: market failure.\nMarket failure occurs when, absent any intervention, the market fails to reach the eﬃcient\noutcome. At the eﬃcient outcome, total surplus is maximized and thus, there is no deadweight\nloss present. It is important to note that the eﬃcient quantity for a good is not always equal to the\nmarket equilibrium quantity!\nCoincidentally, I just recently read an article from the Washington Post that explains a\nreal world scenario involving market failure! For reference, this is the article link:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/07/epa-soot-limit-rule/. The\narticle highlights a negative externality, which is a type of market failure. A negative externality\nis an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others, and can be referred to as\nan external cost. Because of this uncompensated cost, the market actually ends up producing too\nmuch of the certain good/service, and the market equilibrium quantity ends up being greater than\nthe eﬃcient quantity within society.\nThe focus of the article is about the recent regulations that the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) has imposed on the emission of soot into the atmosphere, stemming from the\nexcess amounts of air pollution that cement plants produce. This emission of air pollution\nimposes an uncompensated cost on the society, as many citizens have experienced respiratory\nissues and incurred healthcare costs. These citizens can be referred to as a “third party”\n, and are\nnot directly related to the market for cement, which the cement plants produce. The market for\ncement production is where the negative externality actually occurs, and the market equilibrium\nfor cement exceeds the eﬃcient equilibrium.\nThe cement plants are clearly producing too much cement for the wellbeing of society, as\nexternal costs such as healthcare costs are impacting many individuals. At the current market\nequilibrium, there is deadweight loss and total surplus is not maximized. However, there are\nways to attempt to correct this market failure and ultimately reach eﬃciency.\nFor a negative externality such as the one I have discussed regarding air pollution, one\nfeasible way to reach equilibrium would be to assess a pigouvian tax on the quantity of air\npollution emitted or goods/services that utilize cement. The latter idea is more practical because\nmonitoring exactly how much pollution is being emitted is very diﬃcult. This tax revenue would\nneed to be equal to the total external cost imposed on society. Other ways to move towards\nequilibrium would be imposing production quotas at the eﬃcient quantity, or limiting pollution\nthrough tradable emission permits that create a finite limit to the amount of air pollution that can\nbe present in the atmosphere.\nI hope this email provided some insightful information on the concept of market failure,\nand specifically negative externalities!

      "essay": "‭ Dear friend,‬\n‭ In class we learned that market failure occurs when the market by itself, meaning no‬\n‭ outside or government intervention, fails to be efficient. The market fails to be efficient when‬\n‭ total surplus is not maximized in the market. Market failure can occur due to externalities,‬\n‭ market power, and non-private goods – common resources, public goods, and artificially scarce‬\n‭ goods.‬\n‭ To apply this to a recent example in the news, let’s discuss the Wall Street Journal article‬\n‭ about the space industry and rocket launches' effect on pollution. Pollution is an example of a‬\n‭ negative externality as it’s an uncompensated cost an individual or firm imposes on others. This‬\n‭ is also known as an external cost. In this example, as the rocket launch market increases its‬\n‭ imposing the uncompensated cost of pollution into the air. This article discusses the rocket‬\n‭ launch market's rapid growth with the increased launch of satellites into the atmosphere by‬\n‭ companies and government agencies. However, with each launch, there is the unintended cost of‬\n‭ emissions that was not accounted for in the market's decision to launch the rocket. This impact of‬\n‭ emissions from rocket fuels has extreme consequences in damaging our ozone layer which‬\n‭ contributes to climate change (Hall). Due to this unintended pollution, the marginal cost of‬\n‭ producers increases the total social marginal cost. The social marginal cost changes where the‬\n‭ market is efficient, as market efficiency is found where the marginal cost intersects with marginal‬\n‭ benefit. In this case, there is no positive externality present and therefore the demand, or‬\n‭ consumer's marginal benefit, is the social marginal benefit. At equilibrium, the market for rocket‬\n‭ launches’ intersection is inefficient due to this unintended cost of pollution, and the efficiency is‬\n‭ represented by where social marginal cost and social marginal benefit intersect.‬\n‭ The area between the two intersections is modeled as a triangle on the graph that‬\n‭ represents the negative total surplus or the deadweight loss associated with the market‬\n‭ equilibrium. Negative total surplus, or deadweight loss arises because the market at equilibrium‬\n‭ fails to take into account the externality and therefore doesn’t create all possible total surplus it‬\n‭ can. In the article, the market for rocket launches at equilibrium fails to account for the‬\n‭ unintended cost of pollution, negative externality, during the decision making to launch the‬\n‭ rockets and hence loses total surplus. With a negative externality, the market equilibrium results‬\n‭ in an increased amount of units of the good than the efficient level. In this example, that means at‬\n‭ market equilibrium there are too many rocket launches produced than at the efficient level for‬\n‭ rocket launches resulting by taking into account the unintended cost of pollution.‬\n‭ To solve this market failure of the unaccounted cost of pollution in rocket launching, the‬\n‭ government will need to intervene by attacking the market, rocket launches, or the negative‬\n‭ externality directly, the pollution. I hope this helps you understand market failure with‬\n‭ externalities, using the example of the negative externality of pollution from rocket launches.‬\n‭ (494)‬\n‭ Work Cited‬\n‭ Hall, Shannon. “The New Space Race is Causing New Pollution Problems.”‬‭ New York Times‬‭ , 22‬\n‭ Jan. 2024.‬‭ https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/science/rocket-pollution-spacex-‬\n‭ satellites.html#:~:text=A%20separate%20study%20also%20published,and%20a%20chu‬\n‭ k%20of%20Asia‬‭ .

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\n\tI hope this reaches you well. I understand that you missed the lecture on market failure and are confused by the concept. It is actually a relatively simple idea, and I can help explain it to you, so you know what it means when a market is in failure.\n\tMarket failure occurs when the market fails to reach the efficient outcome meaning it does not maximize total surplus. It is important to note that equilibrium is not the same as efficiency. The equilibrium quantity and price is not the same as the efficient quantity and price. Efficiency can be defined as maximizing society’s total net gain which occurs where the marginal benefit and the marginal cost intersect. When the market fails to be efficient, the market is in failure. An example of what causes market failure are externalities. A positive externality is a benefit that a third party receives from a firm or individual who is not properly compensated for their contribution. An example of a positive externality would be vaccinations because if most people are immunized, then someone who is not vaccinated will benefit from the majority being vaccinated because they are less likely to contract the disease. Even though this externality is beneficial to society, it is still considered a market failure because the vaccination company’s supply is under consumed which means they would not be properly compensated for their societal contribution, so the market is inefficient. A negative externality is an uncompensated external cost that a firm or individual imposes on others. One of the most common examples of a negative externality would be pollution. Pollution occurs when supply from a company is over consumed which leads to a surplus of production and pollutes the environment. Because supply is over consumed and there is a surplus, there is an inefficient allocation of resources, meaning there is a market failure. \n\tThe New York Times recently reported that over 400 million metric tons of plastic are produced annually, and plastic is a material that will forever remain on Earth in some form. Microplastics are the most dangerous form of plastic because they have polluted our oceans and are ingested by fish. Then, humans consume the fish and the microplastics are introduced into our own blood streams which poses a serious threat to our health. Microplastics are an example of a market failure because there is a surplus of production which negatively impacts those who do not contribute to the production of plastics. I will include a link to the article if you are curious about this example of market failure. \n\tI hope this helped you understand the main idea of market failure and let me know if you still have any questions.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?searchResultPosition=2 \n\n\tSincerely,\n\t\tYour Friend\n",

      "essay": "Understanding Market Failure Through the Lens of Healthcare\nHello friend,\nThe term \"market failure\" is frequently used in economics to describe situations in which\nfree markets allocate resources in an inefficient manner. Several things, including externalities,\nshared resources, public goods, and artificially scarce products, can contribute to this\ninefficiency. With the help of the Wall Street Journal news article \"Novo Nordisk Says Ozempic\nDrug Cuts Risk of Kidney Problems,\" I will explain the idea of market failure in relation to\nhealthcare, paying special attention to the function of externalities.\nWhen a free market allocates resources inefficiently, producing less-than-ideal results, it\nis referred to as market failure in economics. Externalities, or the unexpected consequences of\nproduction or consumption that impact parties not directly participating in the transaction, are a\ntypical kind of market failure. Private and societal costs and benefits may differ as a result of\nthese externalities, which can be either positive or negative.\nThe article discusses how Ozempic affects the course of renal disease. According to\nresults from late-stage trials, Ozempic not only helps diabetic patients control their condition but\nalso generates positive externalities by significantly reducing the risk of developing renal\ndisease. This lower risk of renal disease is a positive externality because it helps people outside\nof the drug's immediate user base. Although the article mentions that Ozempic is artificially\nscarce since insurance coverage and cost constraints limit access to the treatment, for the time\nbeing we will concentrate on Ozempic as a positive externality and discuss artificially scarce\nproducts later.\nWord Count: 476\nPositive externalities in the case of Ozempic result from the medication's capacity to\nreduce diabetic patients' risk of kidney disease progression. Nevertheless, in its dealings, the\nmarket does not take these externalities into consideration. The societal advantages of Ozempic's\nimpact on kidney health are not taken into account by the price mechanism, which normally\ndirects resource allocation in open markets. Because of this, the market misvalued the drug's\nactual worth, which results in an ineffective use of resources.\nThe Ozempic case emphasizes how crucial it is to take externalities into account when\nengaging in market transactions, especially in the healthcare industry. Neglecting positive\nexternalities may lead to a shortage of products and services that benefit society more broadly.\nTo establish effective resource allocation and optimize social welfare, policymakers and\nhealthcare providers need to be aware of these market flaws and take appropriate action.\nOzempic serves as an example of how market failure appears in the healthcare industry,\nparticularly when positive externalities are present. We may recognize the limitations of free\nmarkets and the necessity of intervention to address inefficiencies by comprehending the role of\nexternalities in resource allocation. Ensuring fair access to life-saving therapies and boosting\npublic health require addressing market weaknesses in the healthcare sector. Please ask me any\nmore questions if you have any.

      "essay": "Dear Econ 101 friend,\nWhile you’ve been gone, we’ve learned all about market failure. The term “market failure” is when a market of a good or service is not at the efficient level. There are many ways a market can be inefficient; the first way is externalities. There are two types of externalities, positive and negative. A positive externality occurs when there is an external benefit outside of the producer and consumer. This makes the efficient quantity greater than the market equilibrium. A negative externality is the opposite where there is an external cost not accounted for at the market equilibrium. Making the market quantity greater than the efficient level. Another inefficient cause depends on the type of good. These include Common Resources, Public Goods, and Artificially Scare goods. A Common Resource good is inefficient because it is non-exclusive (free to gain access to the good). This causes a “free-rider” problem where consumers can enjoy the good for free therefore making the good overused. Next is Artificially Scare goods, these are non-rival in consumption (doesn’t impact anyone’s enjoyment of good when another person uses) which makes the efficient price for another unit $0. This makes it impossible for the producer to stay in business since it costs money to produce that good. Lastly is a Public Good, which is non-excludable and a non-rival in consumption, this has both problems of the two goods before this. The government usually provides these goods. \n\nIn the article “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns” it describes a current negative externality happening right now. The article talks about how plastics are “a game changer for humanity” (Jacobs) and how the world has doubled production since 2000. With this, though, came a negative byproduct, microplastics. These are not good for humans and the environment. “People who had microplastics in their cardiovascular systems were at heightened risk for complications from heart attacks and strokes” (Jacobs). This is one of the many harmful impacts microplastics cause. Since the production of plastic has a byproduct that doesn’t only impact the producer and consumer of that product, but the entire world it is a negative externality. The producer and consumer doesn’t have the intention of making it a world problem but “plastics are forever and very little of it has been recycled” (Jacobs) which brings the good outside of its own market. This makes a negative external cost, that gets added to the price of the good, and makes a SMC curve shifted left to the supply curve. There are ways you can limit negative externalities though. These include a tax on plastics, a production quota, or an internalized fix. In the article they recommend an internalized fix “that means encouraging consumers to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics” (Jacobs) and also a possible quota, “a treaty proposal that would curb the explosive growth of plastic pollution” (Jacobs). Hope this helps your understanding of market failures. \nFrom,\nYour Econ 101 friend\nWORD COUNT: 485\nA New Film at SXSW Warns of the Potential Harm of Microplastics - The New York Times (nytimes.com)\nWorks Cited\nJacobs, Andrew. “Microplastics Are a Big Problem, a New Film Warns.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 9 Mar. 2024, www.nytimes.com/2024/03/09/health/microplastics-sxsw-health-plastic-people.html?smid=url-share. \n\n",

      "essay": "Dear friend,\nThis past week during your absence we covered market failure, the different types of it, and how it may affect society. Markey failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services is not efficient, so even if a market is at equilibrium, it may not be operating efficiently, failing to maximize social welfare. An inefficient market can be caused by a multitude of things like externalities, and the consequences of each type of good. \nLet me explain a little further, starting with externalities; there are two types, positive and negative. A positive externality is a benefit a firm or individual imposes on others, also known as an external benefit, increasing the efficient quantity and raising the price, moving away from market equilibrium. A negative externality consists of an uncompensated cost that a firm or individual imposes on others, also known as an external cost. This raises the efficient price while reducing the efficient quantity. \nThere are also different types of goods and services that may cause market failure, like public goods, private goods, artificially scarce goods, and common resources. There are two important concepts when thinking about these goods, whether they are excludable or non-excludable, or rival in consumption or non-rival in consumption. Excludable means that the good or service can be withheld from consumers if they do not pay for it, like movies on Netflix. If a good or service is rival in consumption, then that means it cannot be consumed more than once, like a t-shirt. A public good is both non-excludable and non-rival, a private good is both excludable and rival in consumption, an artificially scarce good is excludable but non-rival in consumption, and a common resource is non-excludable but rival in consumption. These goods introduce market failure as firms or individuals manipulate the market in order to obtain profit, and if these goods or services' prices and production are not properly managed then market failure will occur. \nNow all of this at one time may be a little confusing so I have an example to provide. Recently in the Bahamas, there has been an increase in crime/homicide rates, forcing the United States to upgrade the destination to a level 2 travel advisory, meaning tourists must exercise caution when visiting. These criminal activities are seen as a negative externality, imposing costs on other uninvolved individuals and firms. As a result, the tourism and real estate industries will be greatly affected, as the violence encourages fewer visitors. This is a huge problem for the Bahamas as much of its economy relies on the tourism industry. The violence induces a cost on businesses and firms that generate money from tourism, and the island’s overall GDP will take a significant hit. To fix the market failure, the government must step in with actions like subsidizing the police department or funding crime prevention programs to reduce criminal activity and chip away at the gang violence, and the external costs it has on the island’s industries. \nSincerely,\nDanny\n\nWorks Cited\nGrablick, Colleen. “U.S. Issues Travel Advisory in Bahamas after Violent Crimes - The ...” U.S. Officials Warn Travelers about Violent Crime in Bahamas, The Washinton Post, 29 Jan. 2024, www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/01/29/bahamas-travel-advisory-state-department/.\n\n",

      "essay": "Dear Friend,\nIn economics, market failure is a difficult concept to understand. The general idea is that\nmarket failure happens when the free market, operating on its own, does not allocate resources\nefficiently. Therefore not maximizing total surplus.\nThere are several types of market failures, but one that stands out in relation to this article\nis externalities - costs or benefits that affect third parties who did not choose to incur those costs\nor benefits.\nThe article discusses the importance of the Food and Drug Administration’s efforts to\nphase out the use of “forever chemicals”, known as PFAS, in food packaging. PFAS are, “man\nmade compounds that can potentially accumulate in the body over time and take years to break\ndown in nature.” (Amenabar) PFAS compounds have been associated with serious health\nconcerns, yet they're prevalent in fast food wrappers and other containers due to their oil- and\nwater resistant properties. PFAS are still constantly being used.\nWhen companies use PFAS, they do so because the chemical properties are seen as\nbeneficial for their products. However, they don't bear the costs of this decision, the public does.\nThe negative impact on public health from PFAS include increased healthcare costs,\nenvironmental cleanup expense, and the depletion of natural resources. All of these are not taken\ninto account for the price of packaging. These costs are then taken in by society at large, not just\nby those producing or consuming the products.\nThe inability of the market to naturally incorporate these costs of the PFAS in food\npackaging results in overproduction and overuse of these chemicals. Because individual\nconsumers and producers are not bearing the total cost, they have less of an incentive to avoid\nthem, the market then fails to protect the public health and the environment.\nThe challenge with public goods, such as clean air and water, is that they are non\nexcludable and non-rivalrous. This means it is impossible to prevent someone from using them,\nand one person's use does not reduce the availability for others. The role that market failure plays\nis that because it is non excludable and non rivalrous private firms have little incentive to provide\nor maintain these goods because there is no benefit for them.\nIn conclusion, the FDA ’s move to eliminate PFAs from food packaging is their attempt to\neliminate this market failure. It is an action to internalize an externality by reducing the future\nhealth and environmental costs associated with widely used chemicals. Having a better\nunderstanding of these FDA regulations are often essential to address market failures.\nI hope this helps you understand the importance of market failures!\nSincerely,\nY our Friend\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/28/pfas-water-food-forever-chemicals-fda/",

      "essay": "‭ Hello, p‬\n‭ I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take the time to bring up the concept of‬\n‭ market failure, which is a crucial aspect of economics that often plays a role in policy making‬\n‭ and other important governmental decisions. Recently, I came across an article discussing the‬\n‭ Supreme Court's decision to review the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to‬\n‭ regulate pollution that crosses state lines. This case highlights an example of market failure that‬\n‭ calls for government intervention. Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and‬\n‭ services by a free market is not efficient, and the market fails to allocate resources in a way that‬\n‭ maximizes total surplus even in market equilibrium. Externalities, common resources, public‬\n‭ goods, and artificially scarce goods can all play a role in a failing market because each of these‬\n‭ concepts define different aspects of market inefficiencies. In the case of this specific article about‬\n‭ cross-state pollution regulation, the identified market failure is the inability of individual states to‬\n‭ sufficiently manage the negative externalities of downwind pollution originating from their‬\n‭ neighboring states. This market failure can be classified as an environmental externality, which‬\n‭ occurs when the actions of one party impose costs or benefits on others who are not involved in‬\n‭ the transaction. When factories, power plants, etc, in one state produce pollutants into the air it‬\n‭ can travel across state lines, affecting air quality and public health in neighboring states. Because‬\n‭ individual states often prioritize their own internal economic interests over environmental‬\n‭ concerns, they may not implement strict regulations to battle this pollution. As a result, pollution‬\n‭ levels remain high, causing harm to the communities and states downwind. Addressing this‬\n‭ market failure requires coordinated efforts among affected states or government intervention to‬\n‭ establish and enforce regulations that effectively mitigate cross-state pollution. By doing so, the‬\n‭ government can internalize the external costs of pollution, ensuring that polluters bear the full‬\n‭ costs of their actions and incentivizing cleaner production methods.‬\n‭ The Supreme Court's decision to review the EPA's authority in regulating cross-state‬\n‭ pollution highlights the importance of addressing market failures through appropriate‬\n‭ government intervention. By recognizing the existence of externalities and implementing‬\n‭ regulations to address them, governments can promote environmental sustainability and protect‬\n‭ public health for the benefit of society as a whole. I hope this explanation clarifies to you the‬\n‭ concept of market failure and its relevance in real world scenarios in the economy.

      "essay": "To: My Friend\nFrom: Your Friend in Econ 101\nIn lecture and discussion, we have been discussing and learning about market failures and\nexploring different examples that portray them in real-life scenarios. Market failure is when the\nmarket fails to reach an efficient outcome [without government intervention] and does not\nmaximize total surplus. This inefficient outcome can be explained through the concept of\nexternalities which can either be negative or positive. Negative externalities are uncompensated\ncosts imposed on an uninvolved third party, either by an individual or a firm. An example of this\nis pollution where the perpetrator of the pollution will only make decisions based on the direct\ncost of and profit from production, such as a coal manufacturer, without considering how people\ncan be indirectly harmed by the pollution through poor air quality. A positive externality, while\nseemingly beneficial, also leads to market failure because the benefit that someone receives can\naffect others indirectly as they are unable to experience the benefit. Vaccinations exemplify this\nconcept because they benefit the person receiving them, but the people that are left without them\ndue to limited supply, are indirectly negatively affected because they are not protected against\ndiseases and viruses.\nThe New York Times article, “The Most Overlooked Reason Black Americans Are\nMoving South” provides a real-world example of how negative externalities can be truly\ndetrimental to the market. This article discusses the issue of poor air quality due to pollution\ncausing Black Americans to migrate away from big cities in certain states and move to other\nstates to escape such toxic conditions. Using Detroit as an example, car factories only think\nabout the direct costs and profits of running their businesses without considering how their\nactions are affecting nearby citizens in the areas surrounding their plants. A woman in Detroit\nwas even forced to wear a mask in her house due to such poor air quality. These factories are in\nthe areas of Detroit where there is a predominantly African American population (because of\nredlining by the government), causing them to move to other states where the conditions are\nmore livable. Due to this, Detroit will see their tax base receding and be unable to pay for public\ncity improvements such as road repairs, building upkeep, and citywide street cleaning. Tourists\nwill feel the effects of this too and choose different cities to visit, which will also contribute to\nprofit loss in Detroit’s local tax base. However, Southern states that Black Americans are moving\nto are not the safe haven they want it to be, as they are also facing their own issues of climate\nchange and more extreme weather events. Clean air should theoretically be classified as a public\ngood where it is free and can be enjoyed by all, but this proves to be more challenging with\nmanmade circumstances such as factories and power plants polluting the atmosphere and making\nenvironmental conditions nearly impossible to live in.

      "essay": "Good afternoon,\n\tI hope you are well! I’d love to help clear up any confusion regarding market failures from Econ 101 that you missed while away. Understanding market failures is crucial as they occur when, without any intervention, the market fails to reach an efficient outcome, leading to other, less desirable outcomes. This can even apply when in equilibrium. The efficient outcome corresponds to where there is maximum total surplus and resources are allocated to their best possible value. \n\tAn example of a market failure that might resonate with you is the recent news story “Doctors’ Group Offers Free Measles Vaccines in Philadelphia to Fight Outbreak” from ABC News by Mary Kekatos. This real-life scenario describes doctors offering free measles vaccines in Philadelphia in response to a recent measles outbreak. By making the vaccines free, the doctors hope to increase the number of vaccinated individuals to prevent the spread of measles. According to the article, “One dose of the measles vaccine is 93% effective at preventing infection if the recipient is exposed to the virus and two doses are 97% effective…” (Kekatos). Therefore, given the unpredicted rise of the highly contagious disease in Philadelphia and the effectiveness of the vaccine, doctors strongly encourage people in Philadelphia to get vaccinated by making the vaccine more accessible.\n\tThis story is a market failure because the situation represents an externality. An externality is when some costs or benefits impact third parties who aren’t directly involved. In this case, the vaccines in Philadelphia pose a positive externality.  A positive externality is a benefit an individual or firm indirectly imposes on others without receiving compensation or acknowledgment. Positive externalities can cause market failure when the benefits of the positive externality are not realized or accounted for within the market. This leads to a less effective allocation of resources, leading to an inefficient outcome. \nFree vaccines create a positive externality because society benefits when more people are vaccinated to stop measles from spreading. However, when the people of Philadelphia do not realize the benefits of the vaccine and how getting vaccinated could improve the health and safety of the community, there is a market failure. The misallocation of resources present in this market failure is that the gain of herd immunity from an increase in measles vaccinations is not accounted for and internalized within the people of Philadelphia. \n\tThank you for reaching out. I'm here to help, and I encourage you to ask any more questions or if you need further clarification on these concepts!\nSincerely,\nEcon 101 Classmate\nWord Count: 423\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks Cited: \nKekatos, Mary. “Doctors’ Group Offers Free Measles Vaccines in Philadelphia to Fight Outbreak.” ABC News, 24 Jan. 2024, abcnews.go.com/Health/doctors-group-offers-free-measles-vaccines-philadelphia-fight/story?id=106377644.Accessed 17 Mar. 2024.\n\n",
